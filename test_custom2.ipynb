      "The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Oslo, Norway.. On 26 April 2000 criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant and one other person in connection with a traffic accident which had resulted in death of a child.. On 25 February 2003 the Court of First Instance in Podgorica convicted the applicant for endangering public traffic and sentenced him and his co-accused to one year and six months’ imprisonment.. On an unspecified date in 2006 the High Court in Podgorica quashed this judgment and remitted case back to the Court of First Instance.. On 18 April 2007 the Court of First Instance adopted a new judgment and again convicted the applicant and his co-accused. But the court reduced the sentence to one year and four months’ imprisonment.. On 13 November 2009 the High Court further reduced the sentence of the applicant’s co-accused, but upheld the judgment of the Court of First Instance in respect of the applicant..  The applicant’s subsequent appeal against the judgment of the High Court was rejected on 14 June 2010..  Following that rejection, on an unspecified date in 2010, the applicant lodged a further appeal on points of law (zahtjev za ispitivanje zakonitosti pravosnažne presude) with the Supreme Court..  On 26 October 2010 the Supreme Court rejected this appeal..  On 11 December 2010 the applicant lodged an action for fair redress (tužba za pravično zadovoljenje) with the Supreme Court, complaining about the overall length of criminal proceedings. It was rejected on 31 December 2010..  On 19 April 2013 the Constitutional Court rejected the applicant’s ultimate appeal.\n",

      "The applicant was born in 1960.. On 11 August 2006 the applicant, who suffered from schizophrenia, was arrested in his parents’ flat following an argument with his relatives.. The Court, in connection with that incident, in its judgment of V.D. v. Croatia (no. 15526/10, 8 November 2011) found that the investigation into the applicant’s arguable claim of ill-treatment by the police during the arrest had not been effective, contrary to the requirements of the procedural limb of Article 3 of the Convention. It also found that the Government had not furnished any convincing or credible arguments which would provide a basis to explain the manner in which the applicant had sustained his injuries during the arrest. The Court thus concluded that the applicant had been subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment by the police, in breach of the substantive limb of Article 3 of the Convention.. On 16 August 2012, in the context of the procedure for the execution of the Court’s judgment, the Government submitted an action plan indicating that the applicant had sought the reopening of the case against the police officers implicated in the incident (S.P., V.B., D.K. and T.S.) before the relevant criminal courts. To date, the Committee of Ministers has not concluded its supervision of the execution of the judgment under Article 46 § 2 of the Convention.. On 8 March 2013 the Zagreb County Court (Županijski sud u Zagrebu) ordered the reopening of the proceedings against the police officers, S.P. and V.B. That decision was upheld by the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske) on 16 January 2014..  On 4 October 2013 the Zagreb Municipal Criminal Court (Općinski kazneni sud u Zagrebu) ordered that the proceedings against D.K. and T.S., the other two police officers involved in the applicant’s arrest, be reopened. That decision became final on 5 November 2013..  Following the court orders for the reopening of the proceedings against the police officers, the Zagreb Municipal State Attorney’s Office (Općinsko državno odvjetništvo u Zagrebu; hereinafter: “the State Attorney’s Office”) assumed responsibility for conducting the investigation..  On 13 June 2014 the State Attorney’s Office informed the applicant that it had opened an investigation in respect of the police officers concerning his allegations of ill-treatment during his arrest on 11 August 2006. The applicant was also served with the decision on the opening of the investigation, which indicated that in the further course of the proceedings it would be necessary to question him, his parents and his common-law wife, Ms T.V., as well as the relevant police officers, and that a forensic expert report concerning the injuries which the applicant had sustained in the incident would be ordered. In addition, the applicant was served with a list of his rights as a victim in the proceedings, which included, in particular, the right to be represented by a lawyer, to lodge a civil claim, to propose that certain facts be established and evidence obtained in the proceedings, and to have access to the file..  On the same day, the State Attorney’s Office received a letter from the applicant’s lawyer (dated 12 June 2014) asking whether further proceedings would be conducted and whether the applicant would be able to propose that certain evidence be obtained in the proceedings..  In the meantime, the suspect police officers challenged the decision to reopen the investigation. On 10 July 2014 the Zagreb County Court dismissed their appeals. The decision thereby became final..  On 24 September 2014 the State Attorney’s Office summoned the applicant for questioning. The applicant was again provided with a list of his rights as a victim in the proceedings. A summons was served on the applicant’s father, who informed the State Attorney’s Office that the applicant was living abroad and that he was unable to appear for questioning. The applicant also sent a letter to the State Attorney’s Office providing the same justification for his absence. The applicant was then summoned to appear on 30 October 2014..  During his questioning on 30 October 2014, the applicant stated that on the day of the incident he had been at his parent’s flat in Zagreb together with his common-law wife, Ms T.V., and their son. As they had had a dispute, somebody had called the police, who had intervened at the scene. He had first spoken to the police officers but when they had asked him to accompany them to the police station, he had refused. They had then thrown him to the ground face down and had started beating him. At one point they had also handcuffed him and tied his legs. He had managed to bite one of the police officers and as he had been in agony from the beating, he had also bitten his own tongue. The applicant also stated that there had been two paramedics present at the scene..  On 5 November 2014 the applicant’s lawyer asked the State Attorney’s Office to send her a copy of the record of the applicant’s questioning. On 28 November 2014 a copy of the record was sent to her..  In the further course of the investigation, the State Attorney’s Office questioned the applicant’s parents and two other relatives (D.D. and M.D.) who had witnessed the incident, as well as the relevant police officers..  During the questioning, D.D. stated that she had only seen the applicant being taken out of the flat by the police officers. M.D. stated that he had seen the applicant and the police officers talking in the flat and that at one point the applicant had tried to punch one of the police officers, after which the police officers had engaged in suppressing his resistance. However, at that point M.D. had left the room where that had been happening. The applicant’s mother stated that she had left the room after the police officers had handcuffed the applicant and tied his legs. She had then heard screams, and on re-entering the room she had seen a lot of blood and the police officers standing around the applicant. Oral evidence to the same effect was given by the applicant’s father..  The police officers denied ill-treating the applicant. They all provided evidence to the extent that when they had intervened at the scene they had immediately realised that they were facing an individual with a mental disorder. He had threatened to kill them, although he had said that he would spare one of them because he had blue eyes. When they had approached him, the applicant had started to resist so they had decided to handcuff him. At that point, he had bitten the hand of police officer S.P. A commotion had then ensued, in the course of which the applicant had fallen on the ground. He had also started kicking, so the police officers had tied his legs. The applicant had also bitten his tongue and had hit his head against the floor, so the police officers had decided to hold his head and to put him on his side. Afterwards, a medical team had intervened at the scene and the applicant had been taken to hospital..  On 24 November 2014 the State Attorney’s Office ordered a report from a forensic expert, D.M., concerning the injuries which the applicant had sustained following his arrest..  On 27 November 2014 the State Attorney’s Office asked the Zagreb emergency service to provide the names of the members of the medical team who had intervened at the scene during the applicant’s arrest. The next day, the emergency service replied that they could not find the requested information in their records..  However, on the basis of a statement given by one of the suspects, V.B., the State Attorney’s Office established the identity of one of the paramedics who had intervened at the scene. As that person had in the meantime moved out of Zagreb, on 28 November 2014 he was interviewed by telephone. In his interview with the prosecutor he denied having seen any ill-treatment of the applicant during the arrest. However, he stated that the applicant had been very agitated and that he had seen him attacking and biting a police officer..  Meanwhile, on 27 November 2014 the expert, D.M., issued his report.  The expert report indicated that the injuries which the applicant had sustained to his face had been caused by two blows, probably by a fist. The further injuries on his arms, legs and body had been caused either by several blows or possibly also by a fall, as well as by handcuffing. Some of the injuries appeared to have been caused by the body being scratched with an object or dragged across the floor while lying face down. There was also damage to the applicant’s tongue as a result of a bite, but it had been impossible to establish exactly how that injury had been caused..  The State Attorney’s Office found that the forensic expert, D.M., needed to be questioned concerning his report and that he should be presented with some further evidence obtained during the investigation, namely photographs of the crime scene and the individuals concerned taken immediately after the incident, the statements of the relevant police officers and the statement given by the paramedic..  On 28 November 2014 the State Attorney’s Office questioned D.M. The latter stated that the injuries to the applicant’s face could not have been caused when the police officers had attempted to prevent the applicant from self-harming by holding his face, but that it was possible that he had banged his head against the stretcher while being transported by the paramedics. D.M. stressed that, likewise, the tongue laceration which the applicant had sustained could have been caused by his fall and by him banging his head against the stretcher. D.M. also explained that, having seen the photographs of the applicant taken after the incident, he did not believe that the injuries he had sustained had been caused by beating, but were likely to have been caused by the commotion during the arrest..  On 9 December 2014 the State Attorney’s Office, by a reasoned decision analysing all the evidence obtained and the facts established during the investigation, terminated the investigation on grounds of lack of evidence of any ill-treatment or any other excessive use of force by the police during the applicant’s arrest..  The decision to discontinue the investigation was served on the applicant on 15 December 2014. It was served on his lawyer the next day. The applicant was informed that he could take over the proceedings as a subsidiary prosecutor..  The applicant challenged the decision of the State Attorney’s Office before the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske). On 19 February 2015 the Constitutional Court declared the applicant’s complaints inadmissible on the grounds that the impugned decision did not concern any of his civil rights or obligations, or any criminal charge against him..  The decision of the Constitutional Court was served on the applicant’s representative on 5 March 2015..  On 6 December 2007 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against the State in the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court (Općinski građanski sud u Zagrebu), seeking damages for the injuries sustained during his arrest..  In the course of the proceedings, the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court obtained evidence from several expert witnesses concerning the injuries which the applicant had sustained. One of the experts, V.P., concluded that the injuries on the applicant’s body could have been caused by blows or by the body being dragged across the floor, and that the injuries to his hands and legs could have been caused by impact against a hard surface. The injuries on his face had not been properly documented but such injuries were usually caused by punches delivered with lesser intensity. She also found that there had been an injury to the applicant’s tongue. Another expert, S.D., found that it was impossible to draw any firm conclusion as to how the tongue injury had been caused..  On 31 March 2014 the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court ruled in the applicant’s favour. On appeal, the Zagreb County Court increased the amount of compensation for damage, awarding the applicant 17,400 Croatian kunas (HRK). On 20 April 2016 the State paid the applicant in total HRK 66,716.88 (approximately 8,850 euros (EUR)) in compensation for damage, costs and expenses incurred for the proceedings, and interest..  Following intervention by the police and the medical service, the applicant was placed in a psychiatric hospital, where he died on 16 November 2017. An autopsy report indicated that the cause of death was heart failure. An investigation into the event is pending before the relevant State Attorney’s Office.\n",

      "The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Louvencourt.. He was hired in 1976 by the French national railway [[company]] (Société nationale des chemins de fer – “the SNCF”), where he last [[worked]] as Deputy Head of the Amiens Regional Surveillance Unit. He stated that in 2007 he had complained to senior management about the conduct of one of his subordinates, who, he alleged, had used extreme language when addressing a colleague. The employee in question had then filed a complaint against him, following which the applicant had been charged with [[making]] false accusations. The applicant had subsequently been suspended from duty by the SNCF on grounds of that charge.. The proceedings were discontinued a few months later, whereupon the applicant notified his employers of his wish to be reinstated in his former post. He received a reply inviting him to consider appointment to another post, but [[maintained]] his original request.. On the day of his reinstatement, on 17 March 2008, the applicant found that his [[work]] computer had been seized. After being summoned by his superiors, he was informed on 5 April 2008 that the hard disk on the computer had been analysed and that “address change certificates drawn up for [[third]] persons and bearing the Lille General Security Service logo” had been found, as well as a large number of files containing pornographic images and films. It can be seen from the judgment of the Amiens Court of Appeal of 15 December 2010 (see paragraphs 14-15 below) that the person who had replaced the applicant during his [[suspension]] from post had found “documents which had caught his attention” on the computer, and that he had alerted his superiors in March 2007 and January 2008..  A request for a written explanation was sent to the applicant on 7 May 2008. He replied that in 2006, following problems with his personal computer, he had transferred the contents of one of his USB [[keys]] to his [[work]] computer. He added that the files containing pornographic material had been sent to him by people he did not know, via the SNCF’s Intranet..  The applicant was summoned to a disciplinary hearing, which took place on 21 May 2008. On 9 June 2008 he was informed by the “resources management director” of Amiens head office that a proposal had been [[made]] to dismiss him from the [[service]] and that he would be summoned to appear before the disciplinary board. The board convened on 15 July 2008..  On 17 July 2008 the SNCF regional director decided to dismiss the applicant from the [[service]]. His decision was worded as follows:\n",
      "“ ... the [[analysis]] of the files stored on the hard disk of [the applicant’s] [[work]] computer, used for his [[professional]] duties, contained the following:\n",
      "i) change of address certificate, signed in his name, certifying the transfer on 01/11/2003 of Ms Catherine [T.] to the Lille General Security Service; the original certificate, sent to ICF North-East enabled the notice period for vacating her flat to be shortened;\n",
      "ii) change of address certificate, bearing the Ministry of Justice logo, in the name of M. [[[S]].-J.], governor of Fresnes Prison, certifying the transfer of M. [P.] Frédéric to Strasbourg Prison, from 1 November 2006;\n",
      "iii) [[draft]] documents drawn up in the name of Michel [V.], director of the SOCRIF, certifying his [[financial]] situation with regard to that [[company]];\n",
      "iv) a very large number of files containing pornographic images and films (zoophilia and scatophilia).\n",
      "These facts are in breach of the special obligation of [[exemplary]] conduct inherent in the duties formerly [[performed]] by him within the General Security Service, and of the following provisions:\n",
      "i) Article 5.2 of the RH 0006 on the principles governing the conduct of SNCF officials;\n",
      "ii) the general security database RG 0029 (information systems security policy – user’s charter);\n",
      "iii) the RA 0024 “code of [[professional]] conduct” - conduct to be observed with regard to the [[company]]’s information system;\n",
      "iv) Article 441-1 of the Criminal Code.”.  On 28 October 2008 the applicant brought proceedings before the Amiens Industrial Tribunal (conseil des prud’hommes) seeking a ruling that he had been dismissed without genuine or [[serious]] cause. On 10 May 2010 the Industrial Tribunal held that the decision dismissing the applicant from the [[service]] had been justified and, accordingly, rejected his claims.. On 15 December 2010 the Amiens Court of Appeal upheld the substance of that judgment. It held, in particular, as follows:\n",
      "“ ... [The applicant] submitted that the SNCF had infringed his private life by opening, in his absence, files identified as personal in his computer.\n",
      "As a matter of policy, documents kept by employees in the [[company]]’s office, save those identified by them as personal, are presumed to be for [[professional]] use, meaning that the employer can have access to them in the employee’s absence.\n",
      "It can be seen from the report drawn up by the SEF that the pornographic photos and videos were found in a file called “fun” stored on a hard disk labelled “D:/personal data”.\n",
      "The SNCF explained, without being challenged, that the “D” drive was called “D:/data” by default and was traditionally used by staff to store their [[work]] documents.\n",
      "An employee cannot use an entire hard disk, which is supposed to [[record]] [[professional]] data, for his or her private use. The SNCF were therefore entitled to consider that the description “personal data” appearing on the hard disk could not validly prohibit their access to it. In any event, the generic term “personal data” could have referred to [[work]] files being personally processed by the employee and did not therefore explicitly designate elements relating to his private life. That had been the case here, moreover, since the [[analysis]] of the hard disk [[yielded]] numerous [[work]] documents (“LGV photos” file, “warehouse photos” ... .\n",
      "The term “fun”, moreover, does not clearly convey that the file in question is [[necessarily]] private. The term can denote exchanges between colleagues at [[work]] or [[work]] documents kept as “bloopers” by the employee. The employer also rightly pointed out that the user’s charter provided that “private information [had to] be clearly identified as such (“private” option in the Outlook [[criteria]])” and that the same was true of the media receiving that information (“private” folder). The lower court was therefore correct in considering that the file had not been identified as personal.\n",
      "The same applies to the files containing the impugned certificates [[registered]] under the names “Fred [P.]”, “SOCRIF” and “Catherine”.”.  The Court of Appeal also held that the applicant’s dismissal from the [[service]] had not been disproportionate. It observed that both the SNCF’s Code of Professional Conduct and the internal rules provided that staff were required to use the computers provided to them for exclusively [[professional]] ends, with the occasional private use being merely tolerated. It found that the applicant had committed a “massive breach of those rules, going as far as using his [[work]] [[tools]] to produce a forged document”. In the court’s view, those acts had been particularly [[serious]] because, as an official responsible for general surveillance, he would have been expected to be of [[exemplary]] conduct..  The applicant appealed on [[points]] of law. He submitted, in particular, that there had been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention. The Social [[Division]] of the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal in a judgment of 4 July 2012. It held as follows:\n",
      "“ ... whilst files created by an employee with the assistance of the computer facilities supplied to him by his employer for [[work]] purposes are presumed to be [[professional]] in nature, meaning that the employer is entitled to open them in the employee’s absence, unless they are identified as personal, the description [[given]] to the hard disk itself cannot confer privacy on all the data contained in it. The Court of Appeal, which found that labelling the hard disk in the employee’s computer “D:/ personal data” could not enable him to use it for purely private purposes and prohibit access by the employer, drew the legitimate [[conclusion]] that the files in question, which had not been identified as “private” according to the recommendations of the IT charter, could be lawfully opened by the employer.\n",
      "The Court of Appeal, which found that the employee had stored 1,562 pornographic files representing a volume of 787 megabytes over a period of [[four]] years, and that he had also used his [[work]] computer to produce forged certificates, rightly held that such misuse of his office equipment in breach of the rules in [[force]] at the SNCF amounted to a breach of his contractual obligations. ...”.\n",

      "iv) a very large number of files containing pornographic images and films (zoophilia and scatophilia).\n",
      "These facts are in breach of the special obligation of [[warning]] conduct inherent in the duties formerly [[do]] by him within the General Security Service, and of the following provisions:\n",
      "i) Article 5.2 of the RH 0006 on the principles governing the conduct of SNCF officials;\n",
      "ii) the general security database RG 0029 (information systems security policy – user’s charter);\n",
      "iii) the RA 0024 “code of [[pro]] conduct” - conduct to be observed with regard to the [[party]]’s information system;\n",
      "iv) Article 441-1 of the Criminal Code.”.  On 28 October 2008 the applicant brought proceedings before the Amiens Industrial Tribunal (conseil des prud’hommes) seeking a ruling that he had been dismissed without genuine or [[severe]] cause. On 10 May 2010 the Industrial Tribunal held that the decision dismissing the applicant from the [[avail]] had been justified and, accordingly, rejected his claims.. On 15 December 2010 the Amiens Court of Appeal upheld the substance of that judgment. It held, in particular, as follows:\n",
      "“ ... [The applicant] submitted that the SNCF had infringed his private life by opening, in his absence, files identified as personal in his computer.\n",
      "As a matter of policy, documents kept by employees in the [[party]]’s office, save those identified by them as personal, are presumed to be for [[pro]] use, meaning that the employer can have access to them in the employee’s absence.\n",
      "It can be seen from the report drawn up by the SEF that the pornographic photos and videos were found in a file called “fun” stored on a hard disk labelled “D:/personal data”.\n",
      "The SNCF explained, without being challenged, that the “D” drive was called “D:/data” by default and was traditionally used by staff to store their [[sour]] documents.\n",
      "An employee cannot use an entire hard disk, which is supposed to [[immortalise]] [[pro]] data, for his or her private use. The SNCF were therefore entitled to consider that the description “personal data” appearing on the hard disk could not validly prohibit their access to it. In any event, the generic term “personal data” could have referred to [[sour]] files being personally processed by the employee and did not therefore explicitly designate elements relating to his private life. That had been the case here, moreover, since the [[psychoanalysis]] of the hard disk [[bear]] numerous [[sour]] documents (“LGV photos” file, “warehouse photos” ... .\n",
      "The term “fun”, moreover, does not clearly convey that the file in question is [[inevitably]] private. The term can denote exchanges between colleagues at [[sour]] or [[sour]] documents kept as “bloopers” by the employee. The employer also rightly pointed out that the user’s charter provided that “private information [had to] be clearly identified as such (“private” option in the Outlook [[measure]])” and that the same was true of the media receiving that information (“private” folder). The lower court was therefore correct in considering that the file had not been identified as personal.\n",
      "The same applies to the files containing the impugned certificates [[cross-file]] under the names “Fred [P.]”, “SOCRIF” and “Catherine”.”.  The Court of Appeal also held that the applicant’s dismissal from the [[avail]] had not been disproportionate. It observed that both the SNCF’s Code of Professional Conduct and the internal rules provided that staff were required to use the computers provided to them for exclusively [[pro]] ends, with the occasional private use being merely tolerated. It found that the applicant had committed a “massive breach of those rules, going as far as using his [[sour]] [[creature]] to produce a forged document”. In the court’s view, those acts had been particularly [[severe]] because, as an official responsible for general surveillance, he would have been expected to be of [[warning]] conduct..  The applicant appealed on [[tip]] of law. He submitted, in particular, that there had been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention. The Social [[partition]] of the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal in a judgment of 4 July 2012. It held as follows:\n",
      "“ ... whilst files created by an employee with the assistance of the computer facilities supplied to him by his employer for [[sour]] purposes are presumed to be [[pro]] in nature, meaning that the employer is entitled to open them in the employee’s absence, unless they are identified as personal, the description [[disposed]] to the hard disk itself cannot confer privacy on all the data contained in it. The Court of Appeal, which found that labelling the hard disk in the employee’s computer “D:/ personal data” could not enable him to use it for purely private purposes and prohibit access by the employer, drew the legitimate [[termination]] that the files in question, which had not been identified as “private” according to the recommendations of the IT charter, could be lawfully opened by the employer.\n",
      "The Court of Appeal, which found that the employee had stored 1,562 pornographic files representing a volume of 787 megabytes over a period of [[4]] years, and that he had also used his [[sour]] computer to produce forged certificates, rightly held that such misuse of his office equipment in breach of the rules in [[storm]] at the SNCF amounted to a breach of his contractual obligations. ...”.\n",

      "The applicant, a Turkish national, was born in 1980 in Neustadt/Weinstraße (Neustadt) and lives in Speyer. He has a daughter of German nationality, born in 2009, who lives with her mother.. The applicant’s parents had migrated to Germany. In 1982 the applicant witnessed the murder of his mother by his father. His father subsequently fled to Turkey, where he was sentenced to imprisonment, and where he continued to live after his release from prison.. After the death of his mother, the applicant lived and grew up, together with his sister, with his grandparents in Neustadt. He was partly accommodated in a daytime clinic and attended a special needs school, from which he was expelled, without a school certificate, for physical violence against a teacher.. On 25 January 1996, the competent authority of the city of Neustadt issued the applicant a permanent residence permit.. Since 1996 the applicant has repeatedly been convicted of criminal offences. On 26 September 1996 the Neustadt District Court convicted the applicant of drug trafficking and sentenced him to a juvenile sentence of one year and four months, suspended on probation. On 20 July 2000 the same court convicted him on twenty counts of drug trafficking and sentenced him to a juvenile sentence of ten months, again suspended on probation. On 2 July 2001 it convicted him on twelve counts of commercial trafficking of drugs and, cumulating it with the judgment of 20 July 2000, sentenced him to juvenile custody for two years and three months. On 10 January 2002 it convicted him on two counts of attempted aggravated extortion by use of force and, cumulating it with the judgment of 2 July 2001, sentenced him to juvenile custody for four years..  On 18 January 2005 the applicant was released from prison. The [[execution]] of the remainder of his sentence was suspended on probation, subject to the condition of long-term therapy for his drug addiction. The applicant subsequently participated in outpatient drug rehabilitation and a methadone programme..  On an unspecified date in spring/summer 2005 a different District Court convicted the applicant of drug possession and fined him. It established that on 7 May 2005 the applicant had been found in possession of heroin. On 9 July 2007 the Neustadt District Court convicted him of several offences committed in 2005 and 2006, including violent and traffic offences, as well as drug trafficking, and sentenced him to two years and six months’ imprisonment..  In June 2008 the sentence was deferred when the applicant was admitted to a specialist clinic for the purpose of receiving drug therapy. The deferment was revoked two weeks later, after the applicant had been expelled from drug therapy for disciplinary reasons. In August 2008 the sentence was again deferred and the applicant was again admitted to a specialist clinic for the purpose of receiving drug therapy. He was diagnosed with polysubstance dependence, which is simultaneous addiction to different drugs, and a dissocial personality disorder. In February 2009 the [[execution]] of the remainder of the sentence of the judgment of 9 July 2007 was suspended on probation and the applicant was released from prison. He continued therapy..  On 6 November 2009 the applicant was taken into pre-trial custody. On 9 December 2010 the Frankenthal Regional Court convicted him of drug trafficking and acquisition of drugs and sentenced him to four years and three months’ imprisonment. It [[established]] that the applicant had been a heroin dealer since August 2009, in order to finance his own consumption and to earn a living. After serving the initial part of his sentence in prison, the applicant was moved to a psychiatric prison as of August 2011. He was again diagnosed with polysubstance dependence and a combined personality disorder characterised by narcissistic and dissocial symptoms..  The subsequent therapy evolved slowly. In May 2014, the clinic still considered the applicant’s risk of relapse to be significant. It was only in November 2014, after the applicant had graduated from secondary school, that the clinic’s evaluation changed. On 2 December 2014 the applicant was released and the remainder of the sentence was suspended on probation..  On 31 July 2002, after the conviction of 10 January 2002 (see paragraph 9 above), the competent authority of Neustadt ordered the expulsion of the applicant to Turkey. It referred, in particular, to the applicant’s prior convictions. On 22 April 2003, the competent committee on legal affairs (hereafter - “the committee”) rejected the application for administrative review of the expulsion order. On 18 October 2003 the Neustadt Administrative Court rejected the appeal. On 14 January 2005 the Rhineland-Palatinate Administrative Court of Appeal reversed the decision of the Administrative Court and quashed the expulsion order. It established that the applicant could rely on a right of residence under Article 7 of the Decision No. 1/80 of the EEC/Turkey Association Council of 19 September 1980 (see paragraph 30 below). He could hence only be expelled on the basis of a discretionary decision of the authority, requiring a current and concrete danger of further significant criminal offences. Against this background, the reasons provided for the justification of the expulsion order were not sufficient. In this context the Court of Appeal referred, in particular, to the fact that the applicant had at the time not yet undergone inpatient therapy, which he was willing to do. Moreover, the applicant could refer to exceptional life circumstances, in particular the violent death of his mother..  In December 2007 the competent authority notified the applicant that it was willing to order expulsion to Turkey, anew. The applicant informed the authorities that he was now engaged to J., a German national, and that he was intending to undergo stationary treatment of his addiction. On 1 February 2008, the authority nevertheless ordered the expulsion of the applicant to Turkey. It referred to the numerous [[previous]] criminal offences, in particular those after 14 January 2005, and concluded that the applicant posed a sufficiently significant risk to the public..  The applicant applied for administrative review of that decision. On 4 June 2009, shortly after the applicant had acknowledged paternity of the child J. expected at that time, the city committee suspended the proceedings..  The applicant’s daughter was born out of wedlock on 23 September 2009. As of that day, J. exercised sole custody rights. In the following weeks, the applicant lived with his daughter and J. in a common apartment, until he was taken into pre-trial custody in November 2009 (see paragraph 13 above)..  On 19 September 2013, the city committee resumed the suspended proceedings and orally heard the applicant as well as J. who had, in 2011, [[given]] birth to a second child by a different father. On 24 September 2013, the committee rejected the application, maintaining that the applicant posed a current and concrete danger for public safety, as he was likely to commit further significant criminal offences. He was a chronic offender with a high potential for aggressive behaviour. Having regard to the applicant’s interests protected by Article 8 of the Convention, it found the expulsion order to be a proportionate interference..  On 22 May 2014 the Neustadt Administrative Court ordered the reduction of the re-entry ban to five years and dismissed the remainder of the applicant’s appeal. It found that the expulsion order did not contravene the binding force of the judgment of the Court of Appeal of 14 January 2005 (see paragraph 15 above) since it was essentially based on events subsequent to that judgment, in particular the judgments of the District Court of 9 July 2007 (see paragraph 11 above) and the judgment of the Regional Court of 9 December 2010 (see paragraph 13 above). The expulsion order was based on sections 55 § 1 and 56 § 1 of the Residence Act in conjunction with section 14 of Decision No. 1/80 of the EEC/Turkey Association Council of 19 September 1980 (see paragraph 30 below). The authority had correctly [[established]] that the applicant posed a current and concrete danger to the basic interests of Germany, and that his expulsion was indispensable to preserve these basic interests..  The Administrative Court essentially based its conclusions on the seriousness, the frequency and the drug context of the criminal offences, as well as on the expectation that the applicant would be likely to commit such offences again. In this connection, the court referred to the numerous convictions based on drug-related offences, as well as the frequent failure of therapy for his drug addiction. Not even favourable conditions, such as the drug therapy as of August 2008, the suspension of the remaining sentence, further therapy, the expected paternity and finally the birth of his child brought about substantial changes in the applicant’s life. Also, at the time, the treating clinic considered the applicant’s risk of relapse to be significant..  The applicant’s relationship with his daughter was protected by Article 8 § 1 of the Convention. It had, however, been kept from developing more intensely, due to his arrest only months after his daughter’s birth. The same was true for the relationship with his family of origin, in particular his sister. He had also failed to substantiate the actual status of the relationship with J. After initial, rather frequent visits by J. and their common daughter in prison, contact became rather infrequent after J. gave birth to a second child by a different father. The fact that the applicant was about to finish secondary school (see paragraph 14 above) did not justify a more positive prognosis. Since he lacked the necessary vocational [[training]], his prospects of finding a job were still rather [[slim]]. The authorities had correctly taken account of the applicant’s interests, of the fact that he had been born in Germany and that he had family in Germany, in particular his daughter and his sister. [[Making]] explicit reference to Article 8 of the Convention and the Court’s case-law, the Administrative Court [[established]] that the reasons at the heart of the expulsion were sufficient to justify it, even though the expulsion might cause hardship for the daughter, who did not live with the applicant. The applicant’s interests were sufficiently taken into account by limiting the re‑entry ban and he could, moreover, apply for a further reduction of the re‑entry ban, if the relevant facts were to change..  The applicant also lacked economic or social integration. He had never worked and essentially lived on social benefits. As for any difficulties the applicant might face in Turkey, those seemed surmountable. Regarding his allegation that he had no command of the Turkish language, criminal investigations into his offences had shown that he had been perfectly capable of switching between German and Turkish for drug dealing. Also, other oral communication in Turkish had been established, for example two telephone calls with his father from prison. At the oral hearing, he had also conceded that his fluency had improved since 2005. Moreover, the applicant was familiar with Turkish living conditions, since he had visited Turkey twice as a child. His grandfather had shown a rather traditional attitude and he had, in order to improve his Turkish skills, spent a lot of time with family since 2005. He would not be without support in Turkey, even though the relationship with his father might be tense and other contact in Turkey could only be [[established]] through his sister.. On 25 March 2015 the Rhineland-Palatine Administrative Court of Appeal rejected the applicant’s request for leave to appeal, endorsing the Administrative Court’s assessment, while also taking into account the developments that had taken place since..  On 7 October 2015, the Federal Constitutional Court did not accept the complaint for adjudication without providing reasons (no. 2 BvR 826/15)..  An attempt to deport the applicant on 9 October 2015 was unsuccessful, because the applicant did not possess a valid passport..  On 17 December 2015, the applicant submitted an asylum application, invoking the danger of re-traumatisation as a bar to his deportation. He was granted a temporary permit to stay for the purposes of the asylum proceedings (Aufenthaltsgestattung). No information about the current state of these proceedings has been submitted to the Court..  On 17 March 2016 the competent authority rejected an application by the applicant concerning a further reduction of the duration of the re‑entry ban. The applicant appealed against that decision to the Administrative Court. No information about the current state of those proceedings has been provided.\n",

      "The first applicant, Mr S., was born in 1989. The second applicant, Mr V., and the third applicant, Mr A., were both born in 1982..  On Saturday 10 October 2009 from 8 to 10 p.m. a football match between Denmark and Sweden was held in Copenhagen. The stadium had a capacity of 38,000 spectators. Beforehand the police had received intelligence reports of intentions among various club factions from Denmark and Sweden to instigate hooligan brawls. Consequently, in addition to the Copenhagen Police, which was in operation as usual, an extra 186 police officers were called on duty. Most of them wore uniforms throughout the day. They were familiar with members of local football factions..  The three applicants went to Copenhagen to watch the match. They were detained during the day by virtue of section 5(3) of the Police Act (Politiloven) (see paragraph 29 below)..  Altogether 138 spectators/hooligans were detained, approximately half of them under section 755 of the Administration of Justice Act (Retsplejeloven) (see paragraph 35 below), being charged with various criminal offences, while the other half were detained under section 5(3) of the Police Act outside the context of criminal proceedings..  The first applicant was detained from 4.45 p.m. to 12.06 a.m., a total of seven hours and twenty-one minutes..  The second applicant was detained from 3.50 p.m. to 11.27 p.m., a total of seven hours and thirty-seven minutes..  The third applicant was detained from 3.50 p.m. to 11.34 p.m., a total of seven hours and forty-four minutes..  The last disturbances in the city centre of Copenhagen resulting in detentions took place at 10.51 p.m. and 11.21 p.m., at which time it was recorded that a police transport wagon was holding thirty-five detainees (those detained at 10.51 p.m.)..  On 15 October 2009, on behalf of the applicants, their representative requested that the police bring the cases before the courts in order to examine the lawfulness of the detention under chapter 43a of the Administration of Justice Act. She also sought compensation under section 469, subsection 6, of the same Act..  On 4 November 2009, the parties having agreed on a common venue, the cases were brought before the Aarhus City Court (Retten i Aarhus). The applicants, three witnesses on their behalf, the leader of the police operation and four other representatives of the police were heard. The case was tried over three days, on 11 March, 6 September and 28 October 2010..  The applicants explained that they had been part of a group of approximately twenty-five people from Aarhus, who had arrived in Copenhagen well before the match was due to begin. They had met between five and ten friends from Copenhagen and entered a pub. A group of forty or fifty people had afterwards left the pub to find a bigger pub on the Strøget pedestrian shopping street but the police had led them down a side street and detained the second and third applicants and four others. Subsequently, the first applicant had gone with some friends to another pub. Later on he had gone to a square opposite Tivoli Gardens to meet a friend from Aarhus. While standing outside with this friend, and talking on the phone with another friend from Copenhagen, he had been detained. The applicants argued that they had not been involved in any altercations; nor had they had any such intention. They confirmed that on a couple of previous occasions, they had been held in police custody in connection with other football matches..  A “Memorandum on detentions in connection with the international match between Denmark and Sweden on 10 October 2009”, prepared by Chief Inspector B.O., the strategic commander for the event, was submitted to the City Court. It stated that the police had received intelligence reports that hooligan groups from both countries were set on fighting each other on the match day. The risk of fighting was increased by the fact that the match would not start until 8 p.m., leaving considerable time for each group to consume alcoholic beverages beforehand. In order to prevent such clashes, the plan was to start engaging in proactive dialogue from 12 noon, when the first fans/spectators appeared, and in the event of clashes, first to arrest the instigators under section 755 of the Administration of Justice Act and charge them or, if that was not possible, to detain the instigators by virtue of section 5(3) of the Police Act. Since detention under the latter provision, as far as possible, should not exceed six hours, the memorandum specifically stated that it was preferable to avoid detaining anyone too early during the day, since they would then have to be released during or after the game, with the possibility that they would head for the city centre again and resume their involvement in brawls. At 3.41 p.m. the first big fight started between Danish and Swedish supporters at Amagertorv Square, on Strøget in the centre of Copenhagen, resulting in five or six individuals being detained, including the second and third applicants. Subsequently, elsewhere, other supporters were detained, including the first applicant. Up until the start of the match, further individuals who instigated and directed fights were detained, but the manoeuvre tactics continued to be a dialogue to ensure that the large number of supporters behaved and made their way to the stadium to watch the match. After the match, another large brawl started in the city centre, resulting in further detentions of a large group of Swedish and Danish supporters/hooligans..  Before the City Court, Chief Inspector B.O. stated, inter alia:\n",
      "“... that he was the strategic commander for the event and located in the control room in connection with the international football match between Denmark and Sweden on 10 October 2009. The police had received intelligence reports of intentions among various club factions from Denmark and Sweden to initiate hooligan brawls in connection with the match. The police were therefore prepared for it not to be the usual audience of festive Danish and Swedish supporters. This information had come from police ‘spotters’ in different networks of football fans. They had received information that Danish and Swedish groups had planned to collaborate ... Police preparations had targeted different locations in Copenhagen. It was the intention to locate the various groups, talk to them to calm them down and accordingly dampen tempers before they reached the national stadium. The police had already deployed forces and divided them into groups at around 2 p.m. on the basis of intelligence that the spectators would arrive early to go partying. They had managed to locate the groups of fans by means of their spotters, and it had turned out that the fans were divided into a Swedish and a Danish group. They had seen the first large fight between Danish and Swedish hooligans at around 3.40 p.m. The fight had occurred in the central part of Strøget, the pedestrian shopping street, outside bar D, where the Swedish group had settled down. Prior to the fight, they had located the Danish groups in the central courtyard of Boltens Gård. According to the intelligence, the Danish people involved were supporters of the football clubs of Brøndby, Lyngby [Copenhagen] and AGF [Aarhus]. This intelligence had been collected by police officers in the home towns of these clubs. Those police officers had come to Copenhagen to assist, and they had recognised supporters.\n",
      "The fight had taken the police somewhat by surprise, but they had managed to segregate the Swedish supporters at the bar D, and guide the Danish participants down Valkendorffsgade, a small side street off the pedestrian shopping street. It was a group of about fifty to sixty Danish fans altogether. He did not know the number of persons involved directly in the fight, but had understood from local reports that there were about fifty or sixty persons on either side. A fight of this kind causes a lot of uncertainty.\n",
      "He himself had been in the control room, but had had regular contact with people at the scene of the incident. He was the one who had made the decision to detain persons who could not be charged with an offence, that is, detention pursuant to the Police Act. It had been planned that only the instigators should be detained. To the extent possible, they had also intended to avoid detaining many people early in the day because those people would then have to be released during or right after the match and would then be able to head for the city centre again and resume fighting. He had made use of local [police] spotters to identify six leading members, who had then been detained. They had been identified on the basis of police officers’ prior knowledge of them, combined with their ongoing observations. The crucial factor had naturally been the individuals’ actual behaviour. They would not have been detained if they had not been acting as instigators ...\n",
      "The detainees had been released following an assessment of the situation in central Copenhagen. The police had started releasing the detainees after midnight, when the situation in central Copenhagen had calmed down and it had been assessed that there was no one with whom the newly released persons could start a fight. He was, of course, aware of the six-hour rule laid down in the Police Act, but it might be necessary to exceed this maximum period. They had done so deliberately that particular evening. Had there been no violence after the expiry of the six-hour period, there would have been no justification for not releasing the detainees. The purpose had definitely been to avoid confrontations and fights and situations causing uncertainty. They had made a continuous assessment during the period of detention.\n",
      "Normally there were no problems in relation to the six-hour rule in connection with matches played earlier in the day/on weekdays when people did not arrive so early. The control room team had included an investigator who had had regular contact with the Bellahøj police station regarding the detentions. The detainees who had been charged with an offence had been released after the match. As regards the persons detained under the Police Act, a comprehensive, general assessment had been made and then those persons had been released one by one when the danger had passed. He had been involved in the general assessment of the length of the detention periods, but not in the assessment of the individual cases. The control room had been closed down shortly after midnight, when the observers around the city had reported that things were quiet and that people were on their way home/back to their hotels. As already mentioned, it had been decided to release detainees on the basis of a general assessment made in the control room, but the actual releases had been effected at the Bellahøj police station. The police’s assessment had been that the detainees would meet up again and start new fights if released before the streets of the city centre had become quiet ...”.  Police Constable P.W. stated:\n",
      "“... that he had participated as a member of a special patrol in the police action in Copenhagen on 10 October 2009 in connection with the international match. They had received intelligence that hooligans from Aarhus would meet with other hooligans from Denmark to fight Swedish football fans. The Copenhagen Police had asked for help from the police of other districts in Denmark who were familiar with members of local factions. He and his colleagues had met at around 11 a.m. for a briefing. He and a colleague of his from the Police of Eastern Jutland had then moved around the city to look for any hooligans from Aarhus whom they might recognise. They had been told that people from Brøndby had gathered at a particular bar, and they had gone there. Among the people they had seen were [the first and second applicants]. [The second applicant] had been sitting together with A, the leader of South Side United (SSU), which is a local faction from Brøndby. There had been a good atmosphere, and no violence. The witness had remained standing outside for a short while and had talked to people from Aarhus. It had probably been around 1 p.m. He and his colleague and some other officers had then posted themselves opposite the bar to keep an eye on what was going on. They had received reports that Swedes and Danes were to meet and fight. At some point the Danish hooligans had started leaving the bar, walking down the pedestrian shopping street towards Amagertorv Square [around 700 metres from the bar].\n",
      "[The witness] had worked in the special patrol for four years and had met [the first and second applicants] several times at previous fights in connection with football matches. He had seen them take part in fights and heard them shout ‘White Pride Hooligan’. He and his colleagues had followed the group and reported back to the control room. When they had come closer to Amagertorv Square, police personnel carriers had been parked crosswise to prevent the group from colliding with the Swedish football fans. The Danish hooligans had then been turned around and taken down a side street, where they had been registered and searched.\n",
      "They had been told by the control room to select two leading hooligans from Aarhus. He and his colleague had agreed on selecting [the second and third applicants]. It had happened in a calm manner. The reason why [the second applicant] had been taken to the police station was that they had indeed seen him talking to A, combined with their prior knowledge of him. [The third applicant] had also been taken to the police station because of their knowledge of him. [The witness] had written a report on the detentions a couple of hours later.\n",
      "When questioned about Exhibit 46 at the bottom and its continuation on Exhibit 47 at the top [the police reports written by him], according to which both [the second and third applicants] had issued several orders to the other hooligans from Aarhus, the witness stated that he could no longer recall the details, but if this was what he had written, then that was how it had been. The purpose of detaining those two persons had been to create calm and prevent clashes. This had apparently succeeded because he had been present during the international match himself, and it had been obvious that the hooligans from Aarhus had been missing someone to take control. When the group from the bar was being guided into the side street, a couple of people might have tried to disappear into the crowd, but the group had followed directions from the police.\n",
      "White Pride supporters were characterised by being highly structured. It was very clear that someone was in control. Directions were issued by the leaders, and the directions were obeyed. The three factions present at the bar had come from Aarhus, Brøndby and Lyngby and were not usually friends. They had come out together and walked in a group towards Amagertorv Square, where the Swedish hooligans were supposed to be.”.  Police Constable M.W. stated:\n",
      "“... that he had participated in the police action in Copenhagen on 10 October 2009 as a dog handler. He had been involved in the administrative detention of a person [the first applicant] at Axeltorv Square. He did not recall the name of this person, but it was the only person whom he had been involved in detaining. He and a colleague of his had been sitting observing in a car at Axeltorv Square, when a citizen, a man aged 40 to 45, holding his son of about five by the hand, had contacted them saying that three people, whom he had pointed out from a very short distance, were planning a fight as they had been calling various mates, telling them to meet up at the entrance to Tivoli Gardens and try to start a fight with some Swedish supporters. This citizen had overheard the calls just before he had contacted the police, and he had pointed out one of the three persons in particular. The person in question was still talking on his mobile phone at that time. The witness and his colleague considered the person making the report to be highly credible. The person making the report did not look like a typical football supporter.\n",
      "The witness had continued to keep an eye on the person standing with his telephone to his ear. When the three men noticed that the witness and his colleague had caught sight of them, they had started to walk in different directions. The witness had then detained the person who had the telephone to his ear. Some colleagues driving in the police personnel carrier which had arrived in the meantime had detained the other two people ...”.  Chief Inspector P.J. stated:\n",
      "“... that he had been involved in placing detainees in cells, upholding the detentions and releasing the detainees. When the Copenhagen Police planned comprehensive police actions and expected to detain many people, he was usually selected as the person responsible for verifying that standard procedures were observed when the detainees were placed in a cell at Bellahøj police station.\n",
      "On the relevant evening he had been assisted by two leaders, each of whom had assistance from two colleagues in carrying out body searches, and making photo recordings, of the detainees. Ten additional police officers were there to help. One of his tasks had been to make sure that the six-hour rule was observed. They had been faced with the issue that the six-hour period applicable to two of the persons detained under the Police Act expired at 9.50 p.m. He had contacted the control-room supervisor before the expiry of this period. Concurrently, clashes had been starting in the streets, and the control-room supervisor had decided not to let the relevant persons out. They had not wanted to add fuel to the fire. This decision had been made by the supervisors because he himself did not have the power to make such a decision. He had talked to the control room many times during that evening from 9.30 p.m. onwards. Very many detainees had been brought to the police station up until around 11 p.m., reaching a total of 136 detainees. Half of them had been detained under the Police Act. He had regularly asked when they should start releasing the detainees. He had not called and asked about specific names, but a general assessment had been made on an ongoing basis for all detainees from the time when the statutory six-hour periods started to expire. The radio communication had made it possible for him to keep updated about when things started calming down after the arrests of people in the Boltens Gård courtyard, and finally it had been confirmed that he could start releasing the persons detained under the Police Act. He did not keep a log of all telephone calls and was therefore unable to give the exact time. As far as he recalled, there had probably been one detainee under 18 years old who had been fetched by his parents before the end of the six-hour period, but otherwise no one else had been let out before the two initial detainees. It could very well have happened that some of his colleagues had started taking people out of the cells before the end of the six-hour period when they had received the information from the control room, because everybody was highly aware of the six-hour rule. If the persons concerned had subsequently been returned to their cells, the reason was an order from the control room saying that they should continue to be detained.”.  By a judgment of 25 November 2010 the City Court found against the applicants for the following reasons:\n",
      "“The Copenhagen Police ought to have brought the matters before the court within five days of receipt, as set out in section 469(2) of the Administration of Justice Act. The court finds, however, that the non‑submission does not as such give rise to liability making the plaintiffs eligible for compensation.\n",
      "Based on the evidence, the court accepts as fact that the Copenhagen Police had received intelligence prior to the international football match between Denmark and Sweden on 10 October 2009 that Danish and Swedish hooligan groups had arranged to meet in connection with the match and that the police had seen the first large fight between Danish and Swedish football fans at Amagertorv Square at 3.41 p.m. This implied a concrete and imminent risk of disturbance of public order, and the police were under a duty to attempt to prevent such disturbance; see section 5(1) of the Police Act.\n",
      "According to the evidence given by Police Constable P.W., compared with the police report prepared by the same witness on 11 October 2009 (Exhibits 47 and 48), the court accepts as fact that [the second and third applicants] were detained after the witness had specifically seen the persons concerned talking with an activist from the local Brøndby faction of South Side United on 10 October 2009 and issuing orders to others, in combination with the fact that the persons concerned were known to the police for having been detained several times previously in connection with similar football events.\n",
      "The court also accepts as fact, based on the evidence given by Police Constable M.W., compared with the evidence given by Chief Inspector B.O., that [the first applicant], who had also been detained several times previously in connection with similar events, was detained because a person, whom M.W. and his colleague had deemed to be highly credible, had spontaneously contacted him stating that he had just overheard a person, whom he had simultaneously pointed out as being [the first applicant], calling other people by phone and inciting them to start a fight with Swedish football fans at Tivoli Gardens together with him.\n",
      "Less radical measures could not be deemed sufficient to avert the risk of additional unrest in those circumstances, and the court finds that the Copenhagen Police did not exceed their powers by detaining [the applicants] under section 5(3) of the Police Act on that basis.\n",
      "Based on the evidence, the court accepts as fact that during the afternoon and evening, about 138 persons were detained, half of them being detained pursuant to the Police Act; that the unrest continued for the rest of the afternoon and all evening; and that the detention of the plaintiffs was ended as soon as the city centre had become quiet, in the assessment of the police, after a group comprising thirty-five Danes was arrested towards midnight. The court finds, in the circumstances of the present case, that there is no basis for invalidating the assessment made by the police, according to which the release of the detainees before the city centre had become quiet would have entailed a concrete and imminent risk of further unrest, including clashes with spectators who had been let out of the national stadium after the end of the match and who were still in the streets in large numbers.\n",
      "It is stated in the second sentence of section 5(3) of the Police Act that detention must be as brief as possible and should not extend beyond six hours where possible. According to the preparatory notes on this provision, as described in the second column on page 32 of Bill no. 159 of 2 April 2004, the purpose of the detention must be taken into account in this assessment and any person so detained must be released when the circumstances giving rise to the detention no longer exist. It also appears from the preparatory notes on the same provision that normally the six-hour period can only be exceeded in connection with actions involving the detention of a considerable number of people, in which situations the time spent on transfer to the police station and registration and identification of detainees would render it impossible, in practice, to observe the six-hour rule.\n",
      "Whilst the legislative intent of the provision is to extend detention to more than six hours only in exceptional situations, if an extension is not justified by practical issues related to the detention of a large number of people that render it impossible to observe the maximum period, the court finds on the above grounds, in view of the purpose of the detentions compared with the organised nature, scope and duration of the unrest, as well as the length of the specific periods by which the maximum periods had been exceeded, that the conditions for detaining [the applicants] pursuant to section 5(3) of the Police Act for more than six hours were met. Accordingly, there is no basis for awarding compensation to [the applicants].”.  On appeal, for the reasons stated by the City Court, on 6 September 2011 the High Court of Western Denmark (Vestre Landsret) upheld the judgment..  On 12 December 2011, finding that the case raised no issue of principle, the Appeals Permission Board (Procesbevillingsnævnet) refused leave to appeal to the Supreme Court (Højesteret)..  It appears that forty-nine persons (not including the applicants) were charged with criminal offences on the day of the match, notably for breaching the Executive Order on Police Measures to Maintain Public Order and Protect the Safety of Individuals and the Public, etc., and the Right of the Police to Launch Temporary Measures (bekendtgørelse om politiets sikring af den offentlige orden og beskyttelse af enkeltpersoners og den offentlige sikkerhed mv., samt politiets adgang til at iværksætte midlertidige foranstaltninger) (see paragraph 33 below). However, those charges were later withdrawn because it was deemed impossible to obtain sufficient evidence to prove that every single one of the persons charged had committed one or more criminal offences. One person was convicted under section 119 of the Penal Code for having thrown a glass item at a police officer’s head, and another person was convicted under section 121 for having verbally insulted a police officer on duty.\n",

      "The applicants in [[application]] no. 11308/16 (Tlapak) are a mother and father. Their son J. was born on 15 January 2012. The applicants in [[application]] no. 11344/16 (Pingen) are also a mother and father. Their two daughters A. and B. were born on 7 October 2009 and their son G. was born on 23 May 2013. All the applicants are members of the Twelve Tribes Church (Zwölf Stämme) who lived in a community of around twenty members of the church in Wörnitz, Germany. A second community with around 100 members was located in the nearby village of Klosterzimmern.. In 2012 the press reported about the Twelve Tribes Church and its [[position]] on the right of parents to apply corporal punishment, especially caning. Furthermore, statements by a former member of the community were published, confirming that children had been punished with rods.. In 2012 and 2013 the local youth offices (Jugendamt) visited both communities and its spokespersons were invited to a meeting at the Bavarian Ministry of Education. Corporal punishment and the issue of compulsory schooling were discussed at the meeting.. On 16 August 2013 the Klosterzimmern youth office and the Nördlingen Family Court received video footage from a television reporter showing ten different instances of corporal punishment in the community in Klosterzimmern. The footage, filmed with a hidden camera, showed the caning of various children between the ages of three and twelve. According to the television reporter, the person who carried out the punishment was not, in most cases, a parent of the child being punished..  On 3 September 2013 the Ansbach Family Court, upon an [[application]] by the competent youth office, [[made]] an interlocutory order regarding all children in the Twelve Tribes community in Wörnitz, including the applicants’ children. The court withdrew the applicants’ rights to decide where their children should live (Aufenthaltsbestimmungsrecht), and to take decisions regarding their health (Gesundheitsfürsorge), schooling and professional training, and transferred those rights to the youth office. The court [[based]] its decision on the above-mentioned video footage and the testimony of the television reporter and six former members of the Twelve Tribes community. It concluded that there was a reasonable likelihood that the children would be subjected to corporal punishment in the form of caning and so-called “restraining”, involving holding a child’s limbs tight and pressing his or her head down until the child had no strength left to cry and struggle..  On 5 September 2013 the youth office took the community’s children into care. They were supported by around thirty police officers, who, at the same time, searched the community’s premises and found a wooden rod..  The applicants’ children were subsequently examined but no physical signs of abuse or beating were revealed..  J. Tlapak was subsequently placed in a foster family. As he was still being breastfed, his mother was permitted daily visits to give him milk..  A. and B. Pingen were also placed in a foster family. Their aunt’s family was approved as fosterers and they were then placed with them..  Since G. Pingen was then only one year and four months old and was also still being breastfed, he and his mother were placed together in a foster family..  On 13 September 2013 the Ansbach Family Court heard the applicants and on 23 September 2013 it upheld its order of 3 September 2013 in an interim decision..  On 2 December 2013 the Nuremberg Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by the applicants against the interim decision of the Family Court in essence, but set the decision aside to the extent it concerned the parental right to decide on schooling matters. Given the son’s age, the court held that there was no need to decide on that issue in the interim proceedings..  In 2015 the applicants moved – without their son J. – to the Czech Republic, where they have been living since..  The Ansbach Family Court heard the applicants on 13 September 2013 and the applicants’ daughters on 18 September 2013 in the foster family’s home. The daughters reported that their parents had hit them on the hand with a rod as a form of corporal punishment. On 23 September 2013 the Family Court upheld its order of 3 September 2013..  On 2 December 2013, upon an appeal by the applicants, the Nuremberg Court of Appeal reversed the decision to withdraw the right to decide where G. Pingen should live. The earlier decision on the daughters was upheld, with the proviso that the parents were to retain the right to take decisions on school matters and on their daughters’ choice of education or training and career..  The son was subsequently returned to the applicants, who moved first to Belgium and later to the Czech Republic, where they have been living since. The applicants’ daughters are still in the care of the foster family (see paragraph 14 above)..  Upon an [[application]] [[made]] by the applicants on 9 September 2013 the Family Court initiated the main proceedings and, on 24 September 2013, it commissioned an expert opinion..  After interviewing the applicants and observing a meeting between them and their son, the expert submitted a written opinion on 19 December 2013. He found that even though the applicants had a loving attitude towards their son, they considered corporal punishment with objects as an appropriate and necessary parenting method. Owing to their willingness to apply that method to their son, there was a likelihood bordering on certainty that if he remained with them, they would apply corporal punishment. This, the expert concluded, would significantly jeopardise the son’s [[development]] and result in psychological problems. Overall, it was in the child’s best interests to place him away from his parents to protect him from the applicants’ parenting methods, which were dangerous for the child. Since their parenting was [[based]] on religious convictions, they were unwilling to abandon the parenting method of corporal punishment and lacked the will to cooperate with the authorities or accept help. Consequently, less intrusive measures could not be considered sufficient..  Subsequently the applicants submitted a privately commissioned expert opinion, in which the court-appointed expert’s approach and methodology was criticised. In addition, the applicants retrospectively withdrew their consent to being assessed by the court-appointed expert and to an assessment of their son..  In separate proceedings the Family Court, on 1 August 2014, issued an interim decision in which it withdrew the applicants’ parental right to decide on the son’s assessment by the court-appointed expert and consented to such a measure..  On 4 August 2014, the Family Court forwarded the privately commissioned expert opinion to the court-appointed expert, who responded to the criticism and gave details of his methodology in a letter of 15 August 2014..  In a hearing on 19 September 2014 the court proposed an agreement between the applicants and the youth office, with the aim of returning their son to them. However, the applicants and the youth office did not agree on a settlement owing in particular to a disagreement about the son attending a state school and play therapy. [[Moreover]], there were concerns about the parents attending a [[development]] course and assisting with medical measures. The youth office considered those aspects as essential and declined the partial settlement proposed by the applicants..  After hearing the applicants’ son in the home of the foster family where he had been placed on 21 October 2014, the Family Court decided on 22 October 2014 to withdraw the applicants’ right to decide where their son should live and to take decisions regarding his health and schooling, and transferred those rights to the youth office, which had been appointed as supplementary guardian..  The Family Court stated that it would be very detrimental to the best interests of the child if the son continued to live with the applicants owing to their parenting methods. Based, in particular, on the court‑commissioned expert opinion and the statements by the applicants during the court proceedings, the court concluded that there was a high, concrete probability that the son would be subjected to corporal punishment using physical objects over the course of several years. According to the expert, this would give rise to an expectation that the applicants’ son would suffer from psychological issues. Even though separating the parents and the child constituted a severe interference with their right to a family under Article 6 of the [[Basic]] Law (see paragraph 53 below) and may possibly have negative consequences for the child, that interference was justified in the case at hand. Corporal punishment of the kind at issue was particularly degrading for a child. It was not only banned by Article 1631 § 2 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 54 below) but also constituted an interference with a child’s human dignity, protected under Article 1 of the [[Basic]] Law (see paragraph 50 below), and a child’s right to physical integrity, protected under Article 2 of the [[Basic]] Law (see paragraph 51 below)..  The court also held that the risk to the child could not be averted using less drastic measures. Throughout the course of the proceedings the applicants had unreservedly advocated their parenting style and had refused to accept the opinion that the type of corporal punishment they endorsed was covered by the ban on violence under Article 1631 of the Civil Code. The physical effects of such punishment were only short-lived, which was why it would only be possible for the youth office to observe any such effects if it [[made]] unannounced visits and the child had – by chance – been punished immediately prior to such a visit. According to the expert’s explanations, the psychological consequences could, by contrast, only be determined after a longer period of time and they were difficult to discern at first glance. Although the applicants had most recently indicated to the court that they were ready to refrain from corporal punishment in the future, the court regarded such statements as not being compelling since they had not provided any grounds. The Family Court, nonetheless, pointed out that the applicants were free to reach an out-of-court settlement with the youth office concerning the conditions under which the son could be returned after the proceedings had been concluded. However, the [[previous]] settlement proposal had been refused because the applicants had not been willing to agree to have their son take part in play therapy and attend a state school..  In regard to the fact that the applicants had withdrawn their consent to being examined by the court-appointed expert after the expert opinion had already been submitted, both for themselves and their child, the court held that this did not render the expert’s [[report]] unusable in the proceedings. While the court had [[given]] its own consent in place of the parents’ as far as it concerned the son, the parents’ actions on that point could not, in light of the state’s obligation to protect children under constitutional law, hinder the use of the expert opinion in the proceedings. Allowing parents to reject expert opinions they disagreed with by retrospectively withdrawing consent to an examination would prevent any effective protection of children in family court proceedings..  The applicants subsequently appealed against the decision of the Family Court. The Court of Appeal, after hearing the applicants, their son, the son’s guardian ad litem, a representative of the youth office, the court‑appointed expert and the expert commissioned by the applicants, dismissed the applicants’ appeal on 26 May 2015..  In a decision of thirty-nine pages, the Court of Appeal considered in detail the applicants’ statements concerning corporal punishment, publications by the Twelve Tribes Church, the expert’s opinion and the criticism of the [[report]] by the privately commissioned expert. Overall it confirmed the decision and reasoning of the Family Court of 22 October 2014. The court emphasised that not all individual violations of the right to a non-violent upbringing under Article 1631 § 2 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 54 below) could justify a withdrawal of parental authority. However, there was a fear in the applicants’ case that systematic caning with a rod would be the reaction whenever the child was deemed to have broken a rule. There was moreover already a threat to the child’s best interests as he would live in constant fear of suffering physical pain and experiencing the resulting humiliation as psychological suffering. Beatings as such, the court held, constituted child abuse and misuse of parental authority. It was of no relevance whether or not lasting physical injuries occurred..  The court further held that on account of their religious beliefs, the applicants were convinced that their child-rearing methods were legitimate. Accordingly, they were neither willing nor able to avert the danger to their child and the recent contradictory statements they had [[made]] could not be considered as credible..  On 16 August 2015 the Federal Constitutional Court refused to admit a constitutional complaint by the applicants (1 BvR 1467/15), without providing reasons..  The Family Court, upon an [[application]] by the applicants dated 9 September 2013, initiated the main proceedings and on 24 September 2013 commissioned an expert opinion..  After interviewing the applicants, their two daughters and the children’s foster parents, and observing a meeting between the applicants and their children, the expert submitted a written opinion on 23 December 2013. He stated that the applicants and their daughters had confirmed that the parents had used a rod as corporal punishment on the daughters and that even though the applicants had a loving attitude towards their children, they considered corporal punishment using physical objects as an appropriate and necessary parenting method. Given the past incidents of corporal punishment and the applicants’ general willingness to use that method on their children, it was virtually certain that they would subject them to corporal punishment again. The expert concluded that the applicants’ rigid, authoritarian parenting style and their conviction that children should be [[raised]] to obey their parents by means of corporal punishment using physical objects from the age of three conflicted significantly with the best interests of the children and was also detrimental to the unimpaired [[development]] of their personality. He [[expected]] that such methods would likely result in psychological issues. Overall, it was in the best interests of the children to place them away from their parents. Since the applicants’ parenting style was [[based]] on religious convictions, they were unwilling to abandon the parenting method of corporal punishment and were not fully prepared to cooperate with the authorities and accept help. Consequently, measures that infringed on their rights to a lesser degree could not be considered sufficient..  Subsequently, the applicants submitted a privately commissioned expert opinion, in which the court-appointed expert’s approach and methodology was criticised. In addition, the applicants retrospectively withdrew their consent to being assessed by the court-appointed expert and to the assessment of their three children..  In separate proceedings the Family Court, on 1 September 2014, issued an interim decision in which it withdrew the applicants’ parental right to decide on the children being assessed by the court-appointed expert and consented to the psychological examination. It also forwarded the privately commissioned expert opinion to the court-appointed expert, who responded to the criticism in it and gave details of his methodology in a letter of 1 October 2014..  In a hearing of 29 September 2014 the parties discussed an agreement between the applicants and the youth office, with the aim of returning the daughters to the applicants and protecting all three children. However, the applicants and the youth office could not agree on a settlement as there was disagreement in particular on the children attending a state school and therapy. [[Moreover]], the applicants were unwilling to remain in Germany under the supervision of the youth office for an extended period of time..  After hearing the applicants and their daughters several times, including in parallel proceedings, the Family Court decided on 21 October 2014 to withdraw the applicants’ right to decide where all three children should live and to take decisions regarding the children’s health and schooling, and transferred those rights to the youth office, which had been appointed as supplementary guardian. Additionally, the court ordered the applicants’ son to be handed over to the youth office..  In its reasoning, which was similar to that in [[application]] no. 11308/14 (see paragraphs 29-31 above), the Family Court held that the applicants’ parenting methods meant that it would be very detrimental to the best interests of all three children to continue to live with their parents. The court emphasised that the aim of Article 1666 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 55 below) was not to penalise past child abuse or views on parenting that were in contradiction to Article 1631 § 2 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 54 below), but to prevent imminent threats to the best interests of children. Based, in particular, on the opinion by the court‑appointed expert and the statements by the applicants and their children, the court concluded that there was a high, concrete probability that the children would be subjected to systematic corporal punishment using physical objects, which would in turn be detrimental to the best interests of the children in physical and psychological terms. The severe interference with the applicants’ right to a family under Article 6 of the [[Basic]] Law (see paragraph 53 below) by separating them from their children was nonetheless not only justified but also proportionate since the risk to the children could not be averted using milder means. Besides the problem of detecting corporal punishment through unannounced visits by the youth office (see paragraph 30 above), the court also pointed out that the applicants had consistently, over the course of the proceedings, shown a lack of willingness to cooperate with the youth office and had refused to accept state schools, both of which the court found necessary to prevent degrading corporal punishment and ensure the children’s autonomous [[development]]. Furthermore, the court held that it could be [[expected]] that the applicants would leave Germany if their children were returned to them and thereby elude any orderly monitoring and supervision by the competent youth office. Lastly, the court concluded that the withdrawal of the consent to being examined by the court-appointed expert did not hinder the use of the expert opinion in the proceedings (see paragraph 31 above)..  The applicants subsequently appealed against the decision of the Family Court and applied for an interim measure to suspend the order to hand their son over to the youth office..  On 15 December 2014 the Court of Appeal provisionally suspended enforcement of the Family Court’s order on the son. The court held that [[given]] his age, one year and six months, and the fact that he was still being breastfed, enforcement would constitute an especially serious interference with the applicants’ rights. In addition, the son’s young age meant there was no imminent and sufficient risk of him being subjected to corporal punishment..  During the appeal proceedings the applicants proposed a settlement to the Court of Appeal. The applicants would temporarily return to Germany and for two months they would gradually be reunited with their two daughters under the supervision of the youth office. At the end of that period, if the family reunification had been successful, the Family Court’s decision would be set aside and the whole family would move to the Czech Republic..  On 26 March 2015 the Court of Appeal [[conducted]] an oral hearing during which it heard, inter alia, the applicants, their daughters, the court‑appointed expert, the expert commissioned by the applicants and the children’s guardian ad litem. The applicants’ daughters stated that, even though they would like to see their parents more often, they would prefer living with their foster parents. [[Moreover]], a representative of the youth office indicated during the hearing that the applicants had not distanced themselves from their [[previous]] parenting methods in a credible way and that therefore the youth office was not able to agree to the settlement they had proposed..  On 10 June 2015 the Court of Appeal, in a [[detailed]] decision of forty‑five pages, rejected the applicants’ appeal and confirmed the reasoning of the Family Court. The court held that corporal punishment with a rod, prohibited by Article 1631 § 2 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 54 below), constituted the physical abuse of children and if applied regularly and repeatedly the competent authorities were obliged under Article 1666 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 55 below) to intervene and take the necessary measures in the best interests of the children. The applicants’ daughters had consistently stated during the proceedings that they had been caned on a daily basis and the applicants themselves had confirmed that they had “disciplined” their daughters with a rod. The court was convinced that the applicants would continue to use corporal punishment on their children in the future since that parenting method was already firmly established and was [[based]] on religious beliefs from which the applicants had not fundamentally distanced themselves. Their statements had shown that they, in essence, continued to approve of corporal punishment and considered it an appropriate parenting method. The fact that the applicants had recently acknowledged that their children had a right to a non-violent upbringing did not mean they had changed their attitudes to parenting in a permanent way; rather, that had only served a procedural purpose, namely to have their daughters returned to them as soon as possible. In the court’s opinion, the applicants were only prepared to refrain temporarily from corporal punishment. The court was therefore unable to find that the applicants had changed their way of parenting and distanced themselves from corporal punishment in a manner which the court could regard as credible. Consequently, there was an imminent danger of systematic corporal punishment if the two daughters were returned to their parents. The danger also existed for the applicants’ son as there was no fixed age when the applicants started “disciplining” their children as they rather considered it a tool to enforce their parental authority. As the two-year-old son was [[expected]] to start his “phase of defiance” soon, it also had to be [[expected]] that the applicants would respond with caning..  The Court of Appeal also confirmed that the applicants’ withdrawal of their consent to being assessed did not prevent the courts from using the expert opinion as evidence and that there were no less severe measures available to avert the imminent detriment to the best interests of the children resulting from their parents’ use of corporal punishment. In that regard, the court, inter alia, pointed to the fact that the applicants had already left Germany with their son and refused to return to live there permanently. The competent authorities would therefore from the very outset be unable to provide sufficient support to the family or effectively monitor the applicants’ parenting methods..  On 16 August 2015 the Federal Constitutional Court refused to admit a constitutional complaint by the applicants (1 BvR 1589/15), without providing reasons.\n",

      "The applicants in [[coating]] no. 11308/16 (Tlapak) are a mother and father. Their son J. was born on 15 January 2012. The applicants in [[coating]] no. 11344/16 (Pingen) are also a mother and father. Their two daughters A. and B. were born on 7 October 2009 and their son G. was born on 23 May 2013. All the applicants are members of the Twelve Tribes Church (Zwölf Stämme) who lived in a community of around twenty members of the church in Wörnitz, Germany. A second community with around 100 members was located in the nearby village of Klosterzimmern.. In 2012 the press reported about the Twelve Tribes Church and its [[lay]] on the right of parents to apply corporal punishment, especially caning. Furthermore, statements by a former member of the community were published, confirming that children had been punished with rods.. In 2012 and 2013 the local youth offices (Jugendamt) visited both communities and its spokespersons were invited to a meeting at the Bavarian Ministry of Education. Corporal punishment and the issue of compulsory schooling were discussed at the meeting.. On 16 August 2013 the Klosterzimmern youth office and the Nördlingen Family Court received video footage from a television reporter showing ten different instances of corporal punishment in the community in Klosterzimmern. The footage, filmed with a hidden camera, showed the caning of various children between the ages of three and twelve. According to the television reporter, the person who carried out the punishment was not, in most cases, a parent of the child being punished..  On 3 September 2013 the Ansbach Family Court, upon an [[coating]] by the competent youth office, [[wee-wee]] an interlocutory order regarding all children in the Twelve Tribes community in Wörnitz, including the applicants’ children. The court withdrew the applicants’ rights to decide where their children should live (Aufenthaltsbestimmungsrecht), and to take decisions regarding their health (Gesundheitsfürsorge), schooling and professional training, and transferred those rights to the youth office. The court [[ground]] its decision on the above-mentioned video footage and the testimony of the television reporter and six former members of the Twelve Tribes community. It concluded that there was a reasonable likelihood that the children would be subjected to corporal punishment in the form of caning and so-called “restraining”, involving holding a child’s limbs tight and pressing his or her head down until the child had no strength left to cry and struggle..  On 5 September 2013 the youth office took the community’s children into care. They were supported by around thirty police officers, who, at the same time, searched the community’s premises and found a wooden rod..  The applicants’ children were subsequently examined but no physical signs of abuse or beating were revealed..  J. Tlapak was subsequently placed in a foster family. As he was still being breastfed, his mother was permitted daily visits to give him milk..  A. and B. Pingen were also placed in a foster family. Their aunt’s family was approved as fosterers and they were then placed with them..  Since G. Pingen was then only one year and four months old and was also still being breastfed, he and his mother were placed together in a foster family..  On 13 September 2013 the Ansbach Family Court heard the applicants and on 23 September 2013 it upheld its order of 3 September 2013 in an interim decision..  On 2 December 2013 the Nuremberg Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by the applicants against the interim decision of the Family Court in essence, but set the decision aside to the extent it concerned the parental right to decide on schooling matters. Given the son’s age, the court held that there was no need to decide on that issue in the interim proceedings..  In 2015 the applicants moved – without their son J. – to the Czech Republic, where they have been living since..  The Ansbach Family Court heard the applicants on 13 September 2013 and the applicants’ daughters on 18 September 2013 in the foster family’s home. The daughters reported that their parents had hit them on the hand with a rod as a form of corporal punishment. On 23 September 2013 the Family Court upheld its order of 3 September 2013..  On 2 December 2013, upon an appeal by the applicants, the Nuremberg Court of Appeal reversed the decision to withdraw the right to decide where G. Pingen should live. The earlier decision on the daughters was upheld, with the proviso that the parents were to retain the right to take decisions on school matters and on their daughters’ choice of education or training and career..  The son was subsequently returned to the applicants, who moved first to Belgium and later to the Czech Republic, where they have been living since. The applicants’ daughters are still in the care of the foster family (see paragraph 14 above)..  Upon an [[coating]] [[wee-wee]] by the applicants on 9 September 2013 the Family Court initiated the main proceedings and, on 24 September 2013, it commissioned an expert opinion..  After interviewing the applicants and observing a meeting between them and their son, the expert submitted a written opinion on 19 December 2013. He found that even though the applicants had a loving attitude towards their son, they considered corporal punishment with objects as an appropriate and necessary parenting method. Owing to their willingness to apply that method to their son, there was a likelihood bordering on certainty that if he remained with them, they would apply corporal punishment. This, the expert concluded, would significantly jeopardise the son’s [[exploitation]] and result in psychological problems. Overall, it was in the child’s best interests to place him away from his parents to protect him from the applicants’ parenting methods, which were dangerous for the child. Since their parenting was [[ground]] on religious convictions, they were unwilling to abandon the parenting method of corporal punishment and lacked the will to cooperate with the authorities or accept help. Consequently, less intrusive measures could not be considered sufficient..  Subsequently the applicants submitted a privately commissioned expert opinion, in which the court-appointed expert’s approach and methodology was criticised. In addition, the applicants retrospectively withdrew their consent to being assessed by the court-appointed expert and to an assessment of their son..  In separate proceedings the Family Court, on 1 August 2014, issued an interim decision in which it withdrew the applicants’ parental right to decide on the son’s assessment by the court-appointed expert and consented to such a measure..  On 4 August 2014, the Family Court forwarded the privately commissioned expert opinion to the court-appointed expert, who responded to the criticism and gave details of his methodology in a letter of 15 August 2014..  In a hearing on 19 September 2014 the court proposed an agreement between the applicants and the youth office, with the aim of returning their son to them. However, the applicants and the youth office did not agree on a settlement owing in particular to a disagreement about the son attending a state school and play therapy. [[furthermore]], there were concerns about the parents attending a [[exploitation]] course and assisting with medical measures. The youth office considered those aspects as essential and declined the partial settlement proposed by the applicants..  After hearing the applicants’ son in the home of the foster family where he had been placed on 21 October 2014, the Family Court decided on 22 October 2014 to withdraw the applicants’ right to decide where their son should live and to take decisions regarding his health and schooling, and transferred those rights to the youth office, which had been appointed as supplementary guardian..  The Family Court stated that it would be very detrimental to the best interests of the child if the son continued to live with the applicants owing to their parenting methods. Based, in particular, on the court‑commissioned expert opinion and the statements by the applicants during the court proceedings, the court concluded that there was a high, concrete probability that the son would be subjected to corporal punishment using physical objects over the course of several years. According to the expert, this would give rise to an expectation that the applicants’ son would suffer from psychological issues. Even though separating the parents and the child constituted a severe interference with their right to a family under Article 6 of the [[staple]] Law (see paragraph 53 below) and may possibly have negative consequences for the child, that interference was justified in the case at hand. Corporal punishment of the kind at issue was particularly degrading for a child. It was not only banned by Article 1631 § 2 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 54 below) but also constituted an interference with a child’s human dignity, protected under Article 1 of the [[staple]] Law (see paragraph 50 below), and a child’s right to physical integrity, protected under Article 2 of the [[staple]] Law (see paragraph 51 below)..  The court also held that the risk to the child could not be averted using less drastic measures. Throughout the course of the proceedings the applicants had unreservedly advocated their parenting style and had refused to accept the opinion that the type of corporal punishment they endorsed was covered by the ban on violence under Article 1631 of the Civil Code. The physical effects of such punishment were only short-lived, which was why it would only be possible for the youth office to observe any such effects if it [[wee-wee]] unannounced visits and the child had – by chance – been punished immediately prior to such a visit. According to the expert’s explanations, the psychological consequences could, by contrast, only be determined after a longer period of time and they were difficult to discern at first glance. Although the applicants had most recently indicated to the court that they were ready to refrain from corporal punishment in the future, the court regarded such statements as not being compelling since they had not provided any grounds. The Family Court, nonetheless, pointed out that the applicants were free to reach an out-of-court settlement with the youth office concerning the conditions under which the son could be returned after the proceedings had been concluded. However, the [[premature]] settlement proposal had been refused because the applicants had not been willing to agree to have their son take part in play therapy and attend a state school..  In regard to the fact that the applicants had withdrawn their consent to being examined by the court-appointed expert after the expert opinion had already been submitted, both for themselves and their child, the court held that this did not render the expert’s [[paper]] unusable in the proceedings. While the court had [[disposed]] its own consent in place of the parents’ as far as it concerned the son, the parents’ actions on that point could not, in light of the state’s obligation to protect children under constitutional law, hinder the use of the expert opinion in the proceedings. Allowing parents to reject expert opinions they disagreed with by retrospectively withdrawing consent to an examination would prevent any effective protection of children in family court proceedings..  The applicants subsequently appealed against the decision of the Family Court. The Court of Appeal, after hearing the applicants, their son, the son’s guardian ad litem, a representative of the youth office, the court‑appointed expert and the expert commissioned by the applicants, dismissed the applicants’ appeal on 26 May 2015..  In a decision of thirty-nine pages, the Court of Appeal considered in detail the applicants’ statements concerning corporal punishment, publications by the Twelve Tribes Church, the expert’s opinion and the criticism of the [[paper]] by the privately commissioned expert. Overall it confirmed the decision and reasoning of the Family Court of 22 October 2014. The court emphasised that not all individual violations of the right to a non-violent upbringing under Article 1631 § 2 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 54 below) could justify a withdrawal of parental authority. However, there was a fear in the applicants’ case that systematic caning with a rod would be the reaction whenever the child was deemed to have broken a rule. There was moreover already a threat to the child’s best interests as he would live in constant fear of suffering physical pain and experiencing the resulting humiliation as psychological suffering.

The court further held that on account of their religious beliefs, the applicants were convinced that their child-rearing methods were legitimate.

The expert concluded that the applicants’ rigid, authoritarian parenting style and their conviction that children should be [[stir]] to obey their parents by means of corporal punishment using physical objects from the age of three conflicted significantly with the best interests of the children and was also detrimental to the unimpaired [[exploitation]] of their personality. He [[bear]] that such methods would likely result in psychological issues. Overall, it was in the best interests of the children to place them away from their parents. Since the applicants’ parenting style was [[ground]] on religious convictions, they were unwilling to abandon the parenting method of corporal punishment and were not fully prepared to cooperate with the authorities and accept help.

Additionally, the court ordered the applicants’ son to be handed over to the youth office..  In its reasoning, which was similar to that in [[coating]] no. 11308/14 (see paragraphs 29-31 above), the Family Court held that the applicants’ parenting methods meant that it would be very detrimental to the best interests of all three children to continue to live with their parents. The court emphasised that the aim of Article 1666 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 55 below) was not to penalise past child abuse or views on parenting that were in contradiction to Article 1631 § 2 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 54 below), but to prevent imminent threats to the best interests of children. Based, in particular, on the opinion by the court‑appointed expert and the statements by the applicants and their children, the court concluded that there was a high, concrete probability that the children would be subjected to systematic corporal punishment using physical objects, which would in turn be detrimental to the best interests of the children in physical and psychological terms.

Lastly, the court concluded that the withdrawal of the consent to being examined by the court-appointed expert did not hinder the use of the expert opinion in the proceedings (see paragraph 31 above)..  The applicants subsequently appealed against the decision of the Family Court and applied for an interim measure to suspend the order to hand their son over to the youth office..  On 15 December 2014 the Court of Appeal provisionally suspended enforcement of the Family Court’s order on the son. The court held that [[disposed]] his age, one year and six months, and the fact that he was still being breastfed, enforcement would constitute an especially serious interference with the applicants’ rights. In addition, the son’s young age meant there was no imminent and sufficient risk of him being subjected to corporal punishment..  During the appeal proceedings the applicants proposed a settlement to the Court of Appeal. The applicants would temporarily return to Germany and for two months they would gradually be reunited with their two daughters under the supervision of the youth office. At the end of that period, if the family reunification had been successful, the Family Court’s decision would be set aside and the whole family would move to the Czech Republic..  On 26 March 2015 the Court of Appeal [[bear]] an oral hearing during which it heard, inter alia, the applicants, their daughters, the court‑appointed expert, the expert commissioned by the applicants and the children’s guardian ad litem. The applicants’ daughters stated that, even though they would like to see their parents more often, they would prefer living with their foster parents. [[furthermore]], a representative of the youth office indicated during the hearing that the applicants had not distanced themselves from their [[premature]] parenting methods in a credible way and that therefore the youth office was not able to agree to the settlement they had proposed..  On 10 June 2015 the Court of Appeal, in a [[elaborate]] decision of forty‑five pages, rejected the applicants’ appeal and confirmed the reasoning of the Family Court. The court held that corporal punishment with a rod, prohibited by Article 1631 § 2 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 54 below), constituted the physical abuse of children and if applied regularly and repeatedly the competent authorities were obliged under Article 1666 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 55 below) to intervene and take the necessary measures in the best interests of the children.

The competent authorities would therefore from the very outset be unable to provide sufficient support to the family or effectively monitor the applicants’ parenting methods..  On 16 August 2015 the Federal Constitutional Court refused to admit a constitutional complaint by the applicants (1 BvR 1589/15), without providing reasons.\n",

      "–  E. and E.S., a boy and a girl, twins, born on 27 March 2004;\n",
      "–  T., a boy, born on 7 March 2005;\n",
      "–  A.-M., a girl, born on 31 March 2006;\n",
      "–  S., a girl, born on 15 June 2007;\n",
      "–  E.L., a girl, born on 29 June 2008;\n",
      "–  I., a boy, born on 8 October 2009.. The second applicant has been classified as suffering from second‑degree permanent disability on account of psychological disorders.. On 3 October 2013 the applicants married.. In August 2010 the first applicant sent a complaint to the Romanian president, claiming that her father had subjected her to abuse; she stated that he had raped her and threatened her children. She attached to her complaint a medical certificate attesting that in 2008 one of her children had sustained injuries necessity seven to eight days of medical treatment..  Following an investigation, the authorities dealing with the matter established that the first applicant’s allegations had no basis in fact and that the complaint had been drawn up in the context of a conflict between the first applicant and the representative of the religious organisation in her village, who had allegedly excluded her from that community..  The first applicant’s complaint was then transmitted to the authority responsible for monitoring the situation of maltreated or abandoned children, namely the Călăraşi Directorate-General of Social Assistance and Child Welfare (“the DGASPC”, paragraph 12 below), in order to verify the circumstances of the applicants’ children. On 16 September 2010 the DGASPC asked the Social Services Department of the Mănăstirea municipality (“the SPAS”) to look into the education provided to the family’s seven children, verify their welfare situation and their health, and to provide it with all relevant information (see paragraph 12 below)..  In September 2010 the SPAS visited the applicants’ home. It noted that the family lived in an insalubrious house provided by the first applicant’s father and that the applicants took no interest in their children’s health or education. The family’s monthly income amounted to 774 Romanian lei (RON) and this sum was composed of the second applicant’s disability allowance, child allowances and an allowance paid to the first applicant as a single parent. The SPAS’s report also mentioned that the applicants refused to enrol their children in school or with a doctor, and that they restricted their access to outdoor activities and any other activity which could potentially stimulate their integration or adaptation to life within the community. According to the SPAS, the applicants had refused assistance from social-service employees who wished to advise them about their responsibilities towards their children..  Based on the SPAS’s findings (see paragraph 12 above), on 20 September 2010 the DGASPC sent the applicants a letter informing them that, as parents, they had a duty to provide the minimum conditions necessary for their children’s development and also to ensure that they did not neglect them. The DGASPC recommended that the applicants take the following measures:\n",
      "“ –  provide [their children] with an appropriate level of physical cleanliness and clean clothes, [and guarantee the cleanliness] of the house and a proper diet;\n",
      "–  sign up all the children with a family doctor, have them vaccinated and follow any recommended treatment;\n",
      "–  enrol the children aged from three to seven years in a nursery school;\n",
      "–  allow the children to create relationships with [the other children/] ([through] walks, games);\n",
      "–  refrain from subjecting the children to physical and/or verbal violence and from giving them emotionally traumatising messages (do not create [feelings of] fear, isolation, [do not create in them a] lack of confidence).”.  In the same letter, the DGASPC informed the applicants:\n",
      "“The manner in which you fulfil these obligations will be monitored by ... the DGASPC.\n",
      "Should the neglect of the children persist, and if this affects their safety within the family and [if] there is a breach of certain of their rights, urgent protection measures will be taken in respect of the children, even without [your] agreement, in accordance with sections 64, 65 and 66 of Law no. 272/2004 (the Protection of Children’s Rights Act). ...”.  A schedule was drawn up to ensure regular monitoring of the applicants’ family by the social services. On 11 October 2010 the committee responsible for providing support to the Mănăstirea municipal guardianship and welfare office visited the applicants’ home. It submitted a report stating that the applicants claimed not to have signed up their children with a doctor and had no intention of doing so; in addition, although they had enrolled one of the children in nursery school, they did not take him there for fear he would be kidnapped. The committee’s report also noted that the house was made up of two rooms, an entrance corridor and a kitchen, where clothes and wood were piled up together. It added that the house was heated and clean, and that a meal had been prepared..  It further indicated that the second applicant had become anxious and begun raising his voice to complain that he was not receiving allowances for all of his children. Informed that the monitoring of his family would last for several months, the second applicant apparently became agitated and informed the municipal employees that they were not to return to his home. The committee proposed in its report that the monitoring of the applicants’ family should continue..  On 22 December 2010 and 18 January 2011 the SPAS went to the applicants’ home in order to assess the children’s situation and advise the applicants about the measures to be taken in order to meet the DGASPC’s recommendations (see paragraph 13 above). According to the SPAS, the second applicant was very recalcitrant, insulted the social-service employees, refused access to the children and declined to provide them with information about the children. In the reports drawn up after these two visits, the SPAS mentioned that the house was still poorly maintained, that the windows were covered with plastic tarpaulins, and that the door was damaged. It indicated that the children’s situation did not seem to have improved since the monitory of the family had begun, and emphasised the applicants’ refusal to cooperate with the social services and their failure to fulfil their parental obligations. In view of these findings, it suggested that a protective measure be imposed in respect of the children..  On 28 January 2011 a set of measures was prepared in the context of protecting the applicants’ children, “as a result of the parents’ lack of investment in their role, consisting in providing the minimal conditions necessary to raise [their children], care for them, oversee their satisfactory development, educate them and monitor their health”. The SPAS continued to monitor the children’s situation and ensure that welfare benefits were paid to the applicants..  A new report, drawn up on 25 February 2011, indicated that the applicants’ family had little contact with others and that the parents were not collaborating with the social services in respect of the monitoring of their children; their neighbours alleged that they behaved aggressively and that their children were still neglected. This report recommended that a protective measure be adopted in respect of the children..  On 16 and 17 March 2011 the DGASPC drew up two reports about the applicants’ children. These noted the unsanitary conditions in the house, the very poor hygiene conditions and the applicants’ neglect of their children. With regard to this last aspect, the DGASPC noted that the applicants took little interest in their children’s health and refused to send them to school, to participate in social activities and to have contact with others. In its view, the applicants were refusing to cooperate with the authorities in improving the children’s situation. The reports concluded that, given the seriousness of the state of neglect faced by the children and the parents’ lack of agreement to protective measures, emergency placement of the underage children was recommended..  On 21 March 2011 the DGASPC drew up individual protection plans for the applicants’ children, specifying their needs, the persons responsible for them and the support to be provided to the family..  At the DGASPC’s request, in two separate judgments of 6 April 2011 the Călăraşi County Court (the “county court”) ordered the children’s emergency placement and transferred parental rights in their respect to the president of the Călăraşi County Council..  In the absence of appeals, these judgments became final..  On 4 August 2011, in spite of the applicants’ objections, employees of the DGASPC, assisted by a bailiff, police officers and a psychologist gave effect to the judgments of 6 April 2011 (see paragraph 22 above). In consequence, the youngest child, I., was placed with a child-minder in Călăraşi, a town situated about 38 km from the village in which the applicants lived; the oldest children were placed together in a residential centre situated about 88 km from the applicants’ home..   The children underwent psychological and medical tests after being taken into care by the authorities. The test report noted that serious deficiencies had been observed in the children, “resulting from neglect by the parents”. Thus, according to the report, I. was suffering from “recent cerebral paroxysmal events, microcytic hypochromic anaemia and weight‑related hypotrophy”, as a result of which she had been admitted to hospital urgently. As to the children’s intellectual development, the report noted “slight delayed development ... in all the children; speech issues, a limited vocabulary, a minimal level of socialisation, [and] a tendency to withdraw from others”..  On 5 August 2011 the DGASPC drew up a report on the six oldest children, noting as follows:\n",
      "“... The conclusions of the social services’ report indicate shortcomings in the place of residence (the dwelling belongs to C.G.; ..., the habitable area is insufficient and it is furnished and equipped to a minimal standard; the hygiene conditions are precarious, there are significant shortcomings [in housework and in maintaining] cleanliness in the house and also in terms of personal hygiene, clean clothing and food hygiene); financial [difficulties] – [the family’s income] is made up of an allowance for a person with second-degree disability [on account of a] psychological disorder, amounting to 234 [RON], and of State child benefit, amounting to 540 [RON]. It should be noted that although both parents live in the village of Mănăstirea, [the second applicant] has never taken steps to be registered as resident in this municipality... [The first applicant] did not attend school and is not in any paid employment.\n",
      "... the parents’ conduct was found to be negligent...: [they] did not look after or take elementary steps to provide for [their children’s] health (none of the children was registered with a doctor); provided no educational stimulation to their children, had not registered them in nursery school and had limited their right [to take part in] socialisation [activities]. In this context, [the social inquiry report has indicated] language difficulties in six of the children and anxious behaviour (dread, remaining on the side-lines, retreating from strangers, lack of confidence) on account of [their fear] of being kidnapped for organ trafficking.\n",
      "... [The applicants] are known in the community as individuals who generate conflict and tensions, and who frequently accuse, criticise and insult the local authorities and their neighbours for financial reasons (they ask for additional benefits, etc.)...\n",
      "Similar tensions exist in the relationship between the [applicants] and members of their extended family ... The latter have stated that they are unwilling and unable to take care of [the applicants’] children, with whom they have no contact. Although [the applicants have] received psychological and educational assistance to help them fulfil their role, meet their parental obligations and to make conscious provision for the [essential] needs in raising [the children], overseeing their satisfactory development and educating them, their case has continued to be monitored by the SPAS representatives; [however,] they have been unable to enter the [applicants’] home, as communication has always been difficult and accompanied by accusations and threats.\n",
      "[The applicants] have been informed of the effect of neglect on the children’s development and about the option [that is available to the authorities] to limit their parental rights where cases of abuse through negligence are found. The protection measures available have been described to them, including maintaining normal relationships with the children throughout the period of separation from the family. The parents have vehemently rejected the appropriate protection measures and have refused to accept the intervention of specialised authorities.”.  Also on 5 August 2011, I. was examined by a DGASPC psychologist. It was established on that occasion that the child suffered, among other problems, from delayed motor development and language acquisition, and emotional shortcomings. The psychologist recommended cognitive stimulation, particularly in terms of language. Having regard to the findings of this report, the family’s precarious financial position and the parents’ lack of cooperation in spite of the psychological and educational advice provided by the social services, the DGASPC considered that it was necessary to replace the emergency placement measure in respect of I. by a temporary placement order..  The DGASPC submitted two requests to the county court, seeking to have the emergency placement measure replaced by a temporary placement order. It presented the children’s situation as described in the reports of 5 August 2011 (see paragraphs 26 and 27 above) and indicated that no alternative form of care by a family member had been identified..  The applicants, who were present at the hearing and represented by a lawyer acting pro bono, called for the action brought by the DGASPC to be dismissed. They submitted that, in spite of their lack of resources, they were bringing up their children satisfactorily and that the children were not ill..  In two judgments of 7 September 2011 the country court, basing its decision essentially on section 66 of Law no. 272/2004, ordered that the children be temporarily placed in care: by an initial judgment, I. was placed with a child-minder; by the second judgment, the six other children were placed in a special residential centre. Parental rights in respect of all the children were assigned to the president of the Călăraşi County Council..  In reaching this conclusion, the county court noted in its two judgments that the evidence in the case-file indicated that the applicants’ home was not a suitable place to bring up children, as the floor space was too small and poorly equipped, and there was no guarantee that it was clean. It also noted that serious shortcomings had been observed with regard to the personal hygiene and diet of family members. It noted the parents’ negligence with regard to the children’s health and their refusal to send them to school or allow them to take part in social activities. It also noted that, according to the documents in the files, the children’s language development was delayed; they displayed anxiety-related behaviours which, in the county court’s view, had been transmitted by their parents; and there were delays in the development of I.’s motor skills..  The county court added that although the applicants had received psychological and pedagogical advice to help them fulfil their parental duties, they had difficulties in grasping the children’s needs and, through their conduct, still demonstrated negligence towards the underage children. It held that, for the time being, the applicants were not providing the necessary conditions for their children’s satisfactory development and that it was in the children’s best interests to be placed in care on a temporary basis..  The applicants lodged appeals against those judgments. They asked for the action brought by the DGASPC to be dismissed and submitted written evidence..  On 22 and 23 September 2011 the applicants’ six oldest children underwent individual psychological tests. These revealed that all of the children were slightly behind their age cohorts in terms of social and educational development and indicated that they required cognitive and educational stimulation. The children began attending school..  By a final judgment of 7 November 2011, the Bucharest Court of Appeal (“the appeal court”) dismissed the applicants’ appeal against the judgment of 7 September 2011 concerning their six oldest children. It held that the placement measure was justified by the precarious nature of the applicants’ living conditions and by their attitude towards their children. It noted the temporary nature of the measure, which was due to be lifted once the applicants had submitted the necessary financial and non-financial guarantees with regard to raising their children..  By a final judgment of 28 November 2011, the appeal court dismissed the applicants’ appeal against the judgment of 7 September 2011 in respect of I.’s placement. After endorsing the reasoning set out in the first-instance judgment, the appeal court considered that the lawfulness of its findings was confirmed by other evidence added to the case file, such as, for example, the medical report in respect of this child (see paragraph 22 above)..  Following the temporary placement of their children in care, the applicants had work done on the house to improve their living conditions..  At their request, on 10 January 2012 the DGASPC carried out a social inquiry visit to their home. In its subsequent report, it was noted that the applicants had improved their living conditions by furnishing the house to a minimum level and that they now had electricity and access to drinking water. However, the DGASPC noted that the toilet area was not equipped in such a way as to permit privacy and that various sections of the roof had been visibly damaged by storms. After drawing attention to the family’s income, it noted that the applicants had made efforts to maintain contact with their children, whom they had visited on two occasions since they were placed in care, and that the first applicant, at her initiative, had accompanied one of the children to hospital when he was ill. It added that the applicants had stated that they could not afford to travel more frequently to visit the children..  The above-mentioned report further indicated that the municipal authorities, through their representative, had contacted the applicants to propose assistance, which the second applicant had refused. However, the applicants had apparently begun to cooperate with the authorities and to show an interest in maintaining contact with their children and in what they had to do so that the placement measures could be ended. In this connection, the local authorities had encouraged the second applicant to register his residence at the first applicant’s address so that they could receive financial assistance from the municipality, and had informed him of the formalities to be completed. They had been offered psychological testing with a view to joining, as appropriate, a family-support programme to develop and consolidate their parenting skills. The applicants had apparently refused to undergo this testing..  Having regard to those factors, the DGASPC concluded that, for the time being, the conditions for ensuring the children’s safe return to the applicants had not been met: it emphasised the lack of fuel for heating the house and the second applicant’s lack of cooperation with the authorities. It explained that it would be better to delay the children’s return to their family and that the parents needed to achieve a certain level of progress, under the SPAS’s supervision, to acquire the necessary skills to ensure their children’s safety and to be informed of the potential risks to the children. It added that the children’s return to their family in the near future was not to be ruled out; in its view, however, given the need to improve certain conditions so as to ensure their safety, the applicants’ fluctuating attitude in their communication with the authorities and the applicants’ difficulties in grasping and responding to the children’s needs, the placement measure ought to be maintained for the time being..  On 17 January 2012 the DGASPC asked the SPAS to continue to monitor and advise the applicants’ family and to indicate to it those aspects that it still considered deficient in the visit that had been carried out on 10 January 2012 (see paragraphs 38 to 40 above). It also asked the SPAS to inform it of the measures taken to improve the applicants’ living conditions..  On 14 February 2012, following the DGASPC’s request (see paragraph 41 above), the SPAS made another visit to the applicants’ home. On this occasion, it was noted that the applicants were maintaining contact with their children by telephone, since it was difficult for them to travel to the residential centre on account of the wintery weather conditions. The visit report established that the applicants’ physical living conditions had improved and that they had had work done to clean the house. The applicants had promised to enrol the children in school, register them with a doctor, and cooperate with the authorities. The SPAS concluded that the applicants’ living conditions had improved in comparison with those existing when their children were placed in care and that the return of all the children to their family could be envisaged..  In the meantime, on 11 January 2012 the applicants had brought an action against the DGASPC before the county court. They requested that the emergency placement order in respect of their seven children be lifted and that they be returned to the family home. They argued that their living conditions were of a satisfactory standard for raising their children, and submitted to the case file a copy of the agricultural register showing that they had free accommodation, and also an electricity bill, evidence of their income and documents stating that three of their seven children were enrolled in school. They added that the children were not being cared for properly in the residential centre..  The DGASPC did not follow the SPAS’s recommendation (see paragraph 42 above) and asked for the action to be dismissed on the grounds that, although the material living conditions in the applicants’ home had improved, this aspect was not sufficient to ensure the children’s safety. Nonetheless, the social inquiry report on the SPAS’s visit of 14 February 2012 (see paragraph 42 above) was included in the case file..  By a judgment of 15 February 2012, the county court dismissed the applicants’ action on the ground that, in spite of the improvement in their living conditions, they had no other income apart from the allowances they received for their children and that there was no guarantee that these were used exclusively to care for the children. The court stated that those allowances had to cover the needs of the whole family..  The applicants lodged an appeal. They argued that they provided appropriate living conditions to ensure their children’s physical, intellectual and moral development. In addition, the county court had wrongly concluded that their only source of income was from the child allowances, whereas, in their submission, the second applicant was in receipt of two allowances and of income for day-work carried out for various inhabitants of the village. They added that they believed that the family’s income ought to benefit the parents, but more especially the children..  The DGASPC requested that the temporary placement measure be maintained..  No new evidence was added to the case file..  By a judgment of 20 March 2012, the appeal court dismissed the applicants’ appeal. Referring to sections 2, 66 and 68 § 2 of Law no. 272/2004, it considered that the circumstance which had led to the children’s temporary placement in care had changed only in part, and held that the contested measure was to be maintained..  In its judgment, the appeal court began by setting out the reasons justifying the temporary placement measure (see paragraphs 31 and 32 above) and stated that since the children had been placed in care the applicants had visited their six children in the residential centre twice and had visited I. once..  It further noted that, since being placed in care, the children had been examined and treated by a doctor and had joined nursery or primary schools, depending on their age. It noted that the children were all receiving assistance in school from a specialised educator who was monitoring each child’s situation and involving them in specially selected activities to enable them to catch up in those areas where academic delays had been observed when they were placed in care. It stated that, on the basis of the documents in the case file, the children had progressed in terms of independence, personal hygiene and diet since being placed in care and were developing positively..  The appeal court then described the first meeting that had taken place in November between the applicants and the six children who were housed in the residential centre. After describing the children’s reactions, it concluded that the meeting had proceeded normally; the applicants had eaten a meal and played with the children. It noted that the applicants had not expressed any dissatisfaction to the staff about their children’s condition. It further noted that, since that meeting, the applicants had contacted the children by telephone and continued to express their fear that their children would be kidnapped for organ trafficking. However, it noted that the second applicant had refused to give his personal telephone number to the child-care staff so that he could be informed about any issue concerning the children, and that communication was possible only when he himself called the residential centre..  The appeal court then compared the conditions considered necessary by the DGASPC for the children to be returned to their family (see paragraphs 38 and 39 above) with the SPAS’s findings during the social inquiry visit of 14 February 2012 (see paragraph 42 above). It noted that although the applicants had satisfied certain of the conditions imposed by the DGASPC, there remained room for improvement. It held:\n",
      "“The conditions for the children’s reintegration [into the family] have not been met, given that the other criteria laid down by the DGASPC to ensure the children’s safety are not fulfilled: [namely,] the parents’ involvement and cooperation...; the repair of the roof; registration of the [second] applicant’s home in Mănăstirea in order to be able to receive welfare payments; maintenance of links with the children by increasing the regularity of visits; acceptance of their parental responsibilities (registering the children with a doctor, enrolling them in primary and nursery school); the fact of finding employment; improved relations with the other members of the community; undergoing the psychological tests proposed by the DGASPC’s specialists to ascertain their level of parental skills, so as to be able to include them, if appropriate, in a parental support programme and thus develop and consolidate their parental skills; the prevention of major risks to the underage children by accepting monitoring by the Mănăstirea SPAS.\n",
      "....\n",
      "At the same time, the appeal court notes that it has not been conclusively shown that the applicants have sufficient financial resources to support all of their children and to request [the latter’s] return to their family. The two allowances ... received by the [second] applicant, amounting to a total of 646 RON per month, do not represent a source of income that is sufficient to raise and educate seven children, who currently live in better conditions that those that their parents could provide them with. In addition, no evidence has been submitted proving that the applicants have received additional income through day-work carried out in the municipality by the second applicant ....”.  The appeal court concluded that, in any event, the improvements in the applicants’ living conditions noted in the social inquiry report which had been added to the case file (see paragraph 42 above) was not the only condition that the applicants had to fulfil before being able to request their children’s return. According to the appeal court, the applicants had still to fulfil the other conditions laid down by the DGASPC, which were intended to ensure that the children’s best interests were protected..  A social inquiry report drawn up on 2 April 2012 noted that the family’s material conditions had improved, that the applicants were maintaining contact with their children by telephone and that they visited them once a month, the municipal authorities having provided them with fuel for these journeys. The report stated that the family’s monthly income consisted in two allowances received by the second applicant, amounting to a total of RON 646. It was suggested that the municipal authorities make an emergency payment of RON 1,800 to the applicants for repair of the house’s roof and the installation of toilets..  By a decision of 4 April 2012, the municipal council granted the first applicant the above-mentioned RON 1,800 in emergency aid..  On 10 April 2012 the applicants had a confidential interview with a psychologist from the DGASPC. Having been informed of the purpose of the interview, namely to assess their parental skills with a view to the children’s return to the family, the applicants replied to questions. The report drawn up after this interview indicated that the applicants had low parenting skills: they met only their children’s basic needs and were unaware of the effects that their conduct could have on the children’s development. It suggested that the applicants be included in a psychological support programme so as to develop and consolidate their parental skills, inform them about how to exercise their rights, put their parental responsibilities into practice and improve their skills in developing relationships with the wider community..  On 17 April 2012 the second applicant registered his home address at the first applicant’s home..  A visit to the applicants’ home by social services on 26 April 2012 revealed that their living conditions had improved, that the applicants had cooperated with the authorities and that they had begun to take the steps recommended to them for the children’s well-being. The DGASPC suggested that the six children who had been placed in the residential centre be reintegrated into their family..  In May 2012 the children underwent psychological tests, which revealed an improvement in their general condition since they had been placed in care..  By a report of 5 May 2012, the DGASPC noted that the family’s situation had improved, that the applicants had visited their son regularly, shown an interest in his health and displayed affection towards him. It also indicated that meetings had been organised not only between I. and his parents but also with his brothers and sisters. Emphasising the clear interest shown by the applicants towards their child, the DGASPC proposed that the placement measure be ended..  On 7 May 2012 the DGASPC brought an action before the county court requesting that I. be returned to the applicants’ home..  By a judgment of 23 May 2012, the county court decided that it was in I.’s best interests to be returned to his family, especially as the conditions for his satisfactory development had been met and his relationship with his family was very strong..  On 21 June 2012 I. was returned to the applicants’ home..  On 7 May 2012 the DGASPC and the applicants brought an action before the county court requesting that the temporary placement order in respect of the six other children be lifted..  By a judgment of 23 May 2012, the county court dismissed the action. The applicants and the DGASPC lodged an appeal against that judgment..  While that appeal was still pending, the six children spent the summer holiday at the applicants’ home, at their parents’ request. On 10 July 2012 the social services visited the applicants’ home, in the presence of the children. This visit indicated that the children would be able to live and develop in satisfactory conditions in the home. The report on this visit was added to the case file before the appeal court..  By a final judgment of 22 August 2012, the appeal court set aside the first-instance judgment and ordered that the children be returned to their family. It pointed out that Law no. 272/2004 sought to protect the best interests of the child and that the public authorities were required to help ensure that children developed and were raised within their families, and explained:\n",
      "“... although the provision of a certain level of material comfort is an essential element for minors’ development, [it is nevertheless the case that] an inadequate income does not in itself represent an insurmountable obstacle to the children’s return to their family, provided that the parents show a genuine interest in raising the children themselves...”..  The appeal court held that, given the improvement in the applicants’ living conditions through assistance from the public authorities, and the change in their conduct towards their children, it was in those children’s best interests to re-join their family.\n",

      "The applicant was born in 1925 and at the time of the introduction of the application lived in Dublin.. On 20 December 2012 X. (around 55 years old) instituted an action before the Civil Court (Family Section) requesting the court to declare the applicant to be her biological father and to order this to be reflected on her birth certificate.. On 11 February 2013 the Director of the Public Registry (also defendant in the proceedings) requested the court to order that the parties submit themselves to the genetic tests as provided by Article 100A of the Civil Code, and for the applicant to submit his details, which would be required to [[make]] the relevant changes to [[X]].’s birth certificate, if the court had to find in [[X]].’s favour..  On 11 February 2013 the applicant filed written submissions in reply, denying that he had been involved in the applicant’s conception and raising the plea of execeptio plurium concubentium (defence of several lovers) on the basis that X.’s mother had had various partners..  On 7 May 2013 X. filed her written statement confirmed on oath (affidavit), as well as that of her mother. In her affidavit X. claimed that she had been born in London of a relationship between her mother (Y.) and the applicant, and that as of her young age she had always been told that the applicant was her father. After her sixteenth birthday she had sent a letter to him, which remained unanswered. She claimed that in 1978 on having knowledge that the applicant was going to be in Malta she went to meet him at the airport – on that day she had seen him arrive with his family, and noted the resemblance between herself and one of the applicant’s daughters. On that occasion she had not approached him, but they met some time later before a lawyer. She stated that the applicant greeted her warmly and that, after that, they met various times. She also met the applicant’s wife. According to X. the applicant had told her that he would not inform his children about her in order not to disrupt their schooling and she agreed. X. stated that the applicant started visiting Malta regularly on his own and when she had become pregnant he had offered her one of his properties to live in, and in this way they lived there together on his visits to the island. On the birth of X.’s daughter in 1979, the applicant had been the latter’s god parent as shown by relevant certification. She claimed that upon the applicant’s suggestion she moved to the U.K. only to return sixteen months later because she missed Malta. At that stage the applicant had given her the keys to another property for her to reside in. She remained in close contact with him until 1985. In 1998 she was evicted from the property and thereafter their relationship deteriorated. [[X]]. explained that during the eviction proceedings the applicant had promised her a sum of money to leave the premises peacefully, she accepted the deal but he never paid up. Subsequently, she successfully issued proceedings against him to recover the mentioned sum (the relevant court judgments were also submitted)..  According to Y.’s affidavit, Y. had had a relationship with the applicant, for whom she worked, and had become pregnant. She claimed that the applicant had wanted to interrupt the pregnancy and brought a person home to give her an injection. She later miscarried. The applicant had bought her a place where to stay and they used to meet there, since he was married. Y. claimed that she had always been faithful to him as she feared him, given that he was a powerful man involved in criminal activities. Y. stated that she later gave birth to a child she had with him (X.) and thereafter their relationship had deteriorated, to the extent that he had also wanted her to prostitute herself. She finally plucked up courage, left him, and returned to Malta with X..  On 13 May 2013, relying on Article 100A of the Civil Code (see Relevant Domestic Law), X. requested the court to order that genetic tests be undertaken by her and the applicant. Save for her own affidavit and that of her mother she declared to have no further evidence to adduce. On 4 June 2013 the applicant cross-examined Y. The cross‑examination was to continue on a later date. It is unclear whether this occurred..  On 22 May 2013 the applicant objected to the tests on the basis that such an order would breach his human rights. In particular, he argued that Article 100A of the Civil Code (which referred back to Article 70A of the same code) breached his rights under Article 8 of the Convention, and requested the court to refer the matter to the constitutional jurisdictions. He further questioned why the request had been lodged fifty‑three years after X.’s birth and noted his advanced age, arguing that any intervention could have negative medical implications for him..  After hearing submissions from the parties on the matter, on 23 October 2013 the court referred the applicant’s claim to the constitutional jurisdictions..  In his submissions before the constitutional jurisdictions the applicant claimed that none of the aims mentioned in sub‑paragraph two of Article 8 applied in his case, and the law in force did not allow for a fair balance of the competing interests at play. It also imposed an excessive burden in so far as it impeded his possibility of contesting a claim. Moreover, everyone was entitled to institute such proceedings without a shred of evidence, and an alleged father would be bound to submit to the test, with all its consequences, even if he were sure that he was not the father. He claimed that a positive result of the test would disrupt and create havoc in his life after so many years of silence [he was 88 years old]. He requested the court to balance [[X]].’s right (if any) to know who was her father, and his right to respect for his private and family life..  By a judgment of 30 October 2014 the Civil Court (First Hall) in its constitutional competence found that there would be no violation of Article 8 if the Civil Court (in its ordinary competence) were to order the applicant to undergo a genetic test, for the specific purposes of that suit..  The court considered that the enactment of the impugned provisions reflected the State’s action in accordance with its positive obligations in respect of a person’s right to know one’s parentage in the context of a judicial procedure. Citing Pascaud v. France (no. 19535/08, § 64, 16 June 2011) the court reiterated that “the interest of a presumed father was not, alone, a sufficient argument to deprive the applicant [a person seeking to establish paternity] of her Article 8 rights”. According to the court, disproportionality would result had the person seeking paternity acted negligently, by not requesting the test, or not availing him or herself of an available remedy, or had renounced such right, but this was not the case at hand. Referring to the ECtHR case‑law the court noted that while it was true that the absence of an obligatory test did not necessarily entail a violation, it could not be said that [[making]] it obligatory was in violation of Article 8 because it was not proportionate..  Furthermore, the age of [[X]]. was irrelevant to her quest to discover her genetic parent. This was even more so given that she had been trying to establish paternity over the years and that the applicant had been part of her life for a period of time. In that light the applicant could not claim that his family life would now be in havoc..  Lastly, referring to Jäggi v. Switzerland (no. 58757/00, ECHR 2006‑X) which concerned the same circumstances save that the putative father in that case was deceased – the court confirmed that a particularly [[rigorous]] scrutiny was necessary in weighing competing interests in cases of ascertaining parentage, and that a person’s right to ascertain parentage was a vital interest protected by the Convention..  On 10 November 2014 the applicant appealed. He argued, in particular, that by assessing the case under positive obligations, the first‑instance court had failed to assess proportionality. Neither had it looked at the lawfulness of the measure and the legitimate aim – in this connection he contended that since the requirement to order the test was mandatory (unless it concerned a minor), it deprived the judge [[making]] such order of any possibility to balance out the interests at play and to decide according to his or her discretion. Further, the impugned law impinged on the equality of arms principle and was contrary to procedural rules (specifically Article 562 of the Civil Code – see Relevant Domestic Law)..  By a judgment of 26 June 2015, the Constitutional Court rejected the appeal and confirmed the first‑instance judgment..  The Constitutional Court considered that, as was clear from the first‑instance judgment, that court had looked into the proportionality of the measure. While it had focused mostly on the legal aspects of the case, it did not mean that it had not considered the factual elements pertinent to the case, and indeed its conclusions had specifically referred to the case at issue and were not general..  As had been noted by the first-instance court, the Constitutional Court referred to the fact that X. wished for a number of years to find the truth about an important aspect of her personal identity; she also wished to amend her birth certificate which read “unknown father” (and was thus, in her view, incorrect) to avoid further humiliation every time she had to present such certification. She also wanted to establish a claim over the applicant’s property after his death, according to law. Thus, her impelling interest in determining paternity was clear. On the other hand, save for his old age, the humiliation of undergoing the test [a buccal swab], and the havoc the confirmation of such paternity would cause, the applicant had not referred to any further negative effects..  The Constitutional Court recognised the right of X. to have her paternity established for the reasons adduced by her, namely moral and patrimonial interests. On the other hand the applicant had not put forward reasons which were sufficiently valid to find that the application in his case of Article 100A would breach his rights under Article 8. Reiterating the findings in Pascaud (cited above), the Constitutional Court emphasized that the interest of a presumed father was not, alone, a sufficient argument to deprive the applicant [a person seeking to establish paternity] of her Article 8 rights. Indeed, Article 8 paragraph 2 expressly allowed for a legitimate interference with a person’s private life in the case that such interference was “for the protection and rights of others”. This was precisely the case at hand. Thus, the application of the relevant law to the applicant’s case would be justified given that the aim was precisely to establish the identity of the X. and safeguard her patrimonial interest, if it were to be found that she was the applicant’s daughter..  In that light and bearing in mind the applicant’s submissions that Article 70A(2) of the Civil Code excluded any exercise of discretion by the court ordering the test, the Constitutional Court considered that while it was not excluded that there might be cases where the necessary application (applikazzjoni tassativa) of Article 70A(2) of the Civil Code may result in a breach of Article 8, namely where a fair balance has not been reached between the interests at play, in the present case it was not so, given the factual circumstances of the present case. In the Constitutional Court’s view the applicant would not have suffered any humiliation in having to undergo a buccal swab which was not an invasive action, and any turbulence which could be caused to his private and family life did not outweigh X.’s interests..  Lastly, the complaint about equality of arms was frivolous in so far as the test was available to both parties, and also because the fact that a piece of evidence was conclusive evidence in favour of one party did not mean that it should be discarded..  Following the above‑mentioned Constitutional Court judgment, on 18 October 2015 the Civil Court (Family Section) ordered that the proceedings be continued and that the applicant undergo the genetic test. It appointed an expert to conduct such an examination and requested her to submit a report by 28 January 2016..  On 24 May 2016 counsel for the applicant informed the court that inquiries were to be made with the applicant concerning the possibility of him tendering evidence by video conferencing given that he was residing abroad. On 6 October 2016 counsel informed the court that it was likely that the applicant would file an affidavit with his own evidence. However, no such written testimony was submitted..  The applicant submitted to the test and according to a report of the expert issued on 21 February 2017 (submitted to the ECtHR) the probability of paternity, namely of the applicant being [[X]].’s father, was 99.9998%..  From the minutes of the hearing of 6 April 2017, it appears that the expert could not attend that hearing, so the court authorised her to submit the report, and confirm it on oath, at the court’s registry; the court also solicited the applicant’s details. The case was adjourned for judgment. On the same day a note was filed by the applicant indicating his personal details..  On 21 June 2017 Civil Court (Family Section) declared that [[X]]. was the biological child of the applicant and ordered the Director for Public Registry to [[make]] the necessary changes in the act of birth of [[X]]. so to include the details of the applicant. The court judgment referred to the sworn statements of X. and Y. as well as to the DNA report, and the failure of the applicant to [[make]] submissions, opting to limit himself to submitting his personal details. The court noted that X. and Y.’s testimony had not been rebutted as the applicant failed to submit his testimony, and the applicant’s initial objection had been contradicted by the result of the DNA test, which corroborated the witness testimony, particularly that of Y.\n",

      "The applicant was born in 1925 and at the time of the introduction of the application lived in Dublin.. On 20 December 2012 X. (around 55 years old) instituted an action before the Civil Court (Family Section) requesting the court to declare the applicant to be her biological father and to order this to be reflected on her birth certificate.. On 11 February 2013 the Director of the Public Registry (also defendant in the proceedings) requested the court to order that the parties submit themselves to the genetic tests as provided by Article 100A of the Civil Code, and for the applicant to submit his details, which would be required to [[wee-wee]] the relevant changes to [[ex]].’s birth certificate, if the court had to find in [[ex]].’s favour..  On 11 February 2013 the applicant filed written submissions in reply, denying that he had been involved in the applicant’s conception and raising the plea of execeptio plurium concubentium (defence of several lovers) on the basis that X.’s mother had had various partners..  On 7 May 2013 X. filed her written statement confirmed on oath (affidavit), as well as that of her mother. In her affidavit X. claimed that she had been born in London of a relationship between her mother (Y.) and the applicant, and that as of her young age she had always been told that the applicant was her father.

      "The applicant was born in 1960 and lives in Giresun.. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties and as they appear from the documents submitted by them, may be summarised as follows.. On 8 February 2006 the applicant, a caretaker employed at the Public Education Centre (Halk Eğitim Merkezi) in Giresun, was taken into police custody on suspicion of child molestation, after being caught in an allegedly indecent position with X., a 9-year-old pupil at the primary school located in the same building as the Public Education Centre.. On 8 March 2006 the Espiye Public Prosecutor lodged an indictment with the Espiye Criminal Court of First Instance, charging the applicant with the sexual abuse, sexual assault and unlawful detention of a minor, pursuant to Articles 103 § 1 (a), 109 § 3 (f) (5) and 102 §§ 1 and 3 (a) of the Turkish Criminal Code.. During the ensuing criminal proceedings, the Espiye Criminal Court of First Instance heard statements from the applicant, the parents of X., the psychiatrist who had interviewed the girl after the incident, and the teachers and personnel at the Public Education Centre and the neighbouring primary school, including the teacher E.U., who was the sole eyewitness to the incident. Denying the allegations against him, the applicant stated that on the morning in question, he had entered one of the classrooms in the building for cleaning purposes, where the alleged victim was already present with another pupil. While he was busy cleaning, X. had asked for a simit (a type of bread roll) and had attempted to hug him, as a result of which gesture he had lost his balance and fallen onto a desk with X. It was at that point that the teacher E.U. had entered the classroom..  E.U., on the other hand, testified before the trial court that as she opened the door of the classroom in question, she saw the applicant sitting on a desk in the dark with his legs apart, hugging X. who was sitting on his lap, facing the blackboard. Within a matter of seconds, upon seeing her, the applicant threw X. away in panic. E.U. stated that while she had never witnessed similar behaviour by the applicant before, the scene she had seen on the day in question looked suspicious. She also confirmed that there was another pupil in the classroom at the time..  S.P., who worked in the same primary school and was also the uncle of X.’s mother, asserted before the court that although he had never witnessed any suspicious behaviour on the part of the applicant, he had heard a colleague, İ.K., say that the applicant had engaged in indecent behaviour towards some pupils at the school where he had worked previously. However, İ.K., who was the deputy principal at the applicant’s previous school, denied giving S.P. any such information concerning the applicant or hearing any adverse rumours or complaints about him for that matter..  X.’s father alleged that according to the information he had received from M.Ö. and M.K. ‒ respectively an employee and the manager at the Public Education Centre ‒ the applicant had been dismissed from his previous job for similar behaviour. M.Ö. denied this allegation, but M.K. confirmed that the above-mentioned S.P. had given him this information, although he himself had never witnessed any indecent behaviour by the applicant..  Another witness, B.A., confirmed that the applicant had apologised to him following the incident. There is no information in the case-file as to the exact content of this apology..  The psychiatrist who interviewed X. after the incident reported that the latter lacked the mental capacity to comprehend and recount what might have taken place on the relevant day and, for that reason, it would be futile, and possibly harmful for her well-being, for the trial court to question her..  On the basis of all the evidence before it, on 18 December 2008 the Espiye Criminal Court of First Instance ordered the applicant’s acquittal, holding that it was not possible to establish beyond all reasonable doubt that he had committed the sexual acts forming the basis of the charge. The court observed that the statements of the sole eyewitness were contradictory in parts and that they included her personal interpretation of what had actually taken place on the relevant morning. It added that, despite E.U.’s allegation that the applicant had thrown X. to one side upon her entry in the room, no wounds or bruises had been detected on the girl’s body..  On 13 January 2009 the acquittal judgment became final in the absence of any appeal..  Parallel to the criminal proceedings pending before the Espiye Criminal Court of First Instance, a disciplinary investigation was conducted against the applicant in relation to allegations of harassment..  The disciplinary investigation was carried out by two inspectors who took statements from X.’s father, from M.K., the manager of the Public Education Centre, from B.A., a teacher at the primary school, from A.T., the principal of the primary school, and from the applicant, who was being held in detention in relation to the criminal proceedings at the time. The inspectors also took two separate statements from the sole eyewitness, the teacher E.U., under oath and took into account a report from the guidance counsellors of the primary school regarding the psychological and physical development of the minor X. That report, dated 7 January 2003, described the physical and social developmental attributes of the girl as weak and very timid, respectively. The medical diagnosis was stated as autism..  The investigation report which was issued at the end of the disciplinary investigation on 3 April 2006 found the allegations of harassment against the applicant to be well-founded and recommended the dismissal of the applicant from the civil service on the grounds that his conduct constituted “shameful and disgraceful conduct incompatible with the civil service” as provided under section 125 § E (g) of Law no. 657. In coming to this conclusion, the inspectors noted the following:\n",
      "“...The eyewitness, E.U., reported having seen the applicant in a position which made her suspect that he had been in the course of sexually harassing the student, [X.] She explained that the following facts ‒ in particular, the room being dark as a result of the lights having been turned off, the applicant sitting at the desk right next to the door with his legs open with the minor on his lap and the desk in front having been pushed further away, coupled with the fact that he had been caressing the body of the minor and holding her tight around her waist ‒ had led her to conclude that [the applicant] had been attempting to harass her. [She stated that] what she witnessed did not look like a regular display of affection and when she had entered the room, he had thrown the child off him in panic. In his statement, [the applicant] stated that the minor had attempted to hug him while he was cleaning the floor and that, as a result of that gesture he had lost his balance and the minor had sat on his lap. He added that when E.U. entered the room, he was trying to get the minor off him. [The applicant’s] statement that he had fallen onto a desk with the minor as a result of the latter trying to hug him corroborates E.U.’s version of the events. However, the part about him having lost his balance as a result of the minor’s attempt to hug him would be quite unusual given the physical attributes of the minor in question. Moreover, the consistent statements of E.U., taken under oath, who as a mother and an educator seems to have suffered a great deal of emotional distress from these events, give the impression that the allegations against the applicant are well-founded.\n",
      "[...]\n",
      "The event has shocked and distressed the town community as well as the school... The severity of this event is further exacerbated by the fact that the student in question is a mentally disabled child, ... unable to express or defend herself...This is a disgraceful thing for a civil servant. [The event] has also given rise to a criminal investigation instigated by the Espiye Public Prosecutor’s office where [the applicant], is accused of sexually abusing a minor who was born on [...] February 1993 and who was unable to defend herself due to her mental incapacity, and to the remanding in custody of [the applicant].\n",
      "...we are of the opinion that [the applicant] has harassed [X.] and that this conduct, which is proven, falls under situations provided for in section 125 § E (g) of law no. 657, that is to say, “shameful and disgraceful conduct that is incompatible with the civil service”..  On 25 May 2006 the applicant submitted his written defence to the Supreme Disciplinary Council of the Ministry of Education (“the Supreme Disciplinary Council”). He requested at the outset that the investigation be postponed until the criminal proceedings against him on the same allegations had been finalised. Furthermore, denying all accusations, he challenged E.U.’s statements as being wholly subjective and distorting the facts, bearing particularly in mind that the whole incident had taken place within a matter of seconds, as she too had acknowledged, which did not realistically allow her to make the detailed observations that she had recounted to the authorities. He added that it was not logical that he would have committed the alleged act in the presence of another pupil in the classroom right before the start of the classes..  On 5 July 2006 the Supreme Disciplinary Council issued the following decision in relation to the applicant, in so far as relevant:\n",
      "“Upon examination of the file ... and of the defence statement duly taken [from the applicant], the following has been decided:\n",
      "On the basis of the information and documents in the file, the veracity of the act [harassment of X.] attributed to the applicant has been conclusively established... For this reason, it has been decided unanimously to accept the proposal to dismiss the applicant from the civil service in accordance with section 125 § E (g) of the Law no. 657 [on Civil Servants], ...”.  On 30 October 2006 the applicant objected to the Supreme Disciplinary Council’s decision before the Ordu Administrative Court. The applicant argued that his dismissal on the basis of a finding that he had committed the act of sexual harassment of a minor, which is a criminal act, while criminal proceedings were still pending in respect of that self-same allegation violated his right to the presumption of innocence..  On 3 July 2007 the Ordu Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s objection on the following grounds:\n",
      "“The case concerns the dismissal of the [applicant,], who worked as a caretaker, on the basis of the allegations that he harassed [X.] on the premises of the primary school.\n",
      "Section 125 E-g of Law no. 657 provides that shameful and disgraceful conduct that is incompatible with the civil service requires dismissal from the civil service.\n",
      "Section 131 of the same Law also provides that the commencement of criminal proceedings against a civil servant shall not suspend disciplinary proceedings arising out of the same facts and that acquittal or conviction in the criminal proceedings shall not prevent the execution of disciplinary sanctions.”\n",
      "[...]\n",
      "Although it has been argued that the sole eyewitness’s version of the events cannot be taken as a conclusive basis on which to deem that the applicant committed the act imputed to him, on the basis of the evidence in the case-file and in consideration of the position in which the applicant was found in the classroom, as well as the fact that the classroom’s door had been shut and the lights had been turned off and the room was therefore dark as it was also very early in the morning and it was raining [...], having further regard to the statement by the principal of the neighbouring primary school, A.T., during the criminal proceedings acknowledging that the applicant had apologised to him after the incident and that he had also heard rumours about the applicant’s similar indecent behaviour in other schools where he had previously worked, the applicant’s argument has not been found to be credible..  This statement by A.T., referred to in the Ordu Administrative Court judgment, is not mentioned in the judgment of the Espiye Criminal Court of First Instance..  On 28 July 2007 the applicant appealed against the decision of the Ordu Administrative Court, which he considered to be based on groundless accusations. He argued firstly that, in circumstances where the act forming the basis of criminal and disciplinary investigations was one and the same, the criminal proceedings would be better placed to shed light on the circumstances and to arrive at an accurate conclusion regarding the facts than would be those of the disciplinary bodies, whose findings would be at best hypothetical. He pointed out that the administrative court had ignored the presence of another pupil in the classroom at the time of the incident, as well as his explanation that the door had been shut as a result of the draught from the open window. The administrative court had similarly overlooked his service record (sicil dosyası) and the fact that it made no mention of any allegations of misconduct in his previous post, which would be unimaginable if he had really been dismissed from that post for indecent behaviour. He also referred in this connection to the statements of İ.K., the deputy principal at the previous school, denying any such allegations of indecent behaviour..  On 17 November 2009 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal, endorsing the first-instance court’s reasoning and not mentioning the acquittal judgment which had been delivered by the Espiye Criminal Court of First Instance in the meantime..  On 7 July 2010 the Supreme Administrative Court rejected the applicant’s rectification request..  On 27 May 2013, that is to say after lodging his complaint with the Court, the applicant brought proceedings against the Ministry of Education and requested the reopening of the proceedings concerning his dismissal from the civil service. The applicant relied on the Espiye Criminal Court of First Instance’s final judgment of 18 December 2008, which acquitted him of the charges of sexual abuse, sexual assault and the unlawful detention of a minor, and argued before the Ordu Administrative Court that his right to the presumption of innocence had been violated in the course of the dismissal proceedings because he had been dismissed on the basis of allegations that he had committed offences in respect of which the criminal proceedings had not yet become final. On 24 October 2013, the Ordu Administrative Court dismissed the case, holding that the arguments put forward by the applicant for reopening proceedings did not fall within the exhaustive list of permissible grounds for this extraordinary remedy..  In their observations on 14 March 2014, the Government informed the Court that appeal proceedings were pending before the Supreme Administrative Court.\n",

      "The [[first]] applicant was born in 1983. She lives in Vilnius and has three children. The [[first]] time she gave birth was in 2009 in a public hospital in Vilnius. According to the applicant, the doctors therein were rude and rebuked her for her wish to give birth at home, and she felt humiliated and for a long time afterwards could not discuss her [[experience]] of giving birth at the hospital without tears coming to her eyes. For those reasons, in 2011 she gave birth to her [[second]] child at home, with the assistance of an unlicensed doula (pribuvėja), J.I.Š. That birth passed without complications and without the need for medical intervention.. After falling pregnant for a third time, and with no possibility of giving birth at home owing to the fact that criminal charges had been brought in respect of the above-mentioned doula, J.I.Š. (see paragraphs 31‑35 below), on 9 May 2012 the [[first]] applicant asked two public hospitals – one in Vilnius and one in Kaunas – to [[provide]] her with medical assistance during the home birth that she was planning. Both hospitals refused on the grounds that [[providing]] such assistance was prohibited under Lithuanian law – namely, under Medical [[Regulation]] MN 40:2006 (see paragraph 44 below).. On 13 June 2012 the [[first]] applicant asked the Ministry of Health to either guarantee the provision of such medical assistance during the birth of her third child or to amend the [[secondary]] legislation so that healthcare professionals could be allowed to [[provide]] such assistance. She considered that the participation of a healthcare professional in the birth was indispensable in order to guarantee the child’s and her safety. She indicated that she would give birth on 4-5 July 2012.. By a letter of 5 July 2012 the Ministry of Health replied that it had already received proposals from several non-governmental organisations that births outside hospitals be regulated. The Ministry then consulted numerous medical organisations – [[including]] the Lithuanian Midwives Association (Lietuvos akušerių sąjunga), the Lithuanian [[Fellowship]] of Midwives and Gynaecologists (Lietuvos akušerių ir ginekologų draugija), the Lithuanian Doctors Association (Lietuvos gydytojų sąjunga), the obstetrics and midwifery clinics of both Vilnius University and the Lithuanian University of Health [[Sciences]] – for their views on home birth. However, the specialists were unanimous in the conclusion that it was safest for a woman to give birth on a maternity ward, even when there was little risk of complications. It was impossible to foresee that any birth would pass without complications, and it was always possible that a woman giving birth or a newborn baby might need urgent medical assistance that could be [[provided]] only on a maternity ward.. The Ministry also pointed out that Lithuania had [[made]] great efforts to ensure that safe healthcare [[services]] were [[provided]] to women giving birth (gimdyvė), and that the conditions in maternity wards were designed to render them as close as possible to the home environment. For that purpose medical establishments were supplied with modern medical equipment; at the same time, a woman’s family members could be [[present]] during birth, and medical institutions were being encouraged to obtain the status of “newborn-friendly”. Over the [[previous]] twenty years Lithuania had achieved good [[results]] in significantly reducing the mortality rate of pregnant women, women giving birth and babies. To [[provide]] midwifery [[services]] at home, where there were not all the facilities necessary to be able to [[provide]] help to women giving birth and to the newborn, would constitute a step backwards. Similarly, to shift the legal and financial liability onto the healthcare specialist or healthcare institution in question would likewise not be acceptable. [[Moreover]], the question of home birth concerned not only the woman’s, but also the [[State]]’s choice; at the same time, it was necessary to balance the interests of society and the rights of the [[individual]]. This view was supported by the Court’s judgment in Ternovszky v. Hungary, (no. 67545/09, § 24, 14 December 2010). Accordingly, the Ministry had no plans to initiate changes to [[secondary]] legislation that would regulate the provision of midwifery [[services]] at home..  The [[first]] applicant states in her application that on 11 July 2012 she “[gave] birth at home without qualified healthcare assistance and risked her and the baby’s life and health”..  The [[second]] applicant was born in 1979. She lives in Vilnius and has three children. She indicated in her application that she had given birth at home in 2006, 2008 and 2011, with the assistance of J.I.Š., the above‑mentioned doula. [[All]] three births had been “successful”..  The [[second]] applicant [[submitted]] that after she had fallen pregnant for a fourth time, and “not being able to safely give birth at home” owing to criminal charges having been brought in respect of the above-mentioned doula, J.I.Š. (see paragraph 6 above and paragraphs 31-35 below), she in April 2012 asked two public hospitals – one in Trakai and one in Vilnius – to [[provide]] her with medical assistance during the home birth that she was planning. Both hospitals refused, on the same grounds as those given in the [[first]] applicant’s case (see paragraph 6 above). Afterwards, the Ministry of Health also refused a request lodged by the [[second]] applicant for changes to be [[made]] to the relevant legislation, for reasons [[identical]] to those cited in respect of the [[first]] applicant’s case (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above)..  In her application to the Court of 19 October 2012 the [[second]] applicant noted that she was “firmly resolved (tvirtai nusiteikusi) to give birth at home, irrespective of whether she would receive qualified assistance during the birth”. Her due date was 17 November 2012..  The third applicant was born in 1982. She lives in Vilnius. She noted in her application that she had given birth at home in 2009 and 2010, with the assistance of the unlicensed doula, J.I.Š. Both births had been “without complications [and] successful, and the children [were] growing up and [[developing]] healthily”..  In her application of 19 October 2012, the third applicant stated that – wishing to have more children and expecting to become pregnant as soon as possible, but also having learned of the criminal charges brought against the doula J.I.Š. – in spring 2012 she became an [[active]] member of the movement known as “gimimas.lt” (see paragraphs 26 and 31-35 below). The applicant stated to the Court that during her third pregnancy, having had positive experiences during the [[first]] two home births, she could not imagine herself giving birth outside her home, since this seemed to her “the safest, most tranquil [environment] ... for the most intimate of occasions”..  In September 2012 she asked three public hospitals in Vilnius to [[provide]] her with medical assistance during her home birth. [[All]] the hospitals refused, on the grounds that in Lithuania there was no legal basis on which to [[provide]] medical assistance during a home birth. The head of the Maternity and Obstetrics Clinics at the Vilnius University Hospital (Vilniaus universiteto Akušerijos ir ginekologijos klinika) also indicated that she did not have the right to oblige medical personnel to [[provide]] medical [[services]] outside the hospital. Nevertheless, she invited the third applicant to visit the maternity ward of those clinics in order to “get acquainted with the environment, [which is] a cosy [one] for a woman giving birth”..  On 21 September 2012 the third applicant then asked the Ministry of Health to either guarantee medical assistance at her home during the birth of her third child or to amend the relevant [[secondary]] legislation so that the healthcare professionals were permitted to [[provide]] such assistance. She also argued that if the two relevant pieces of [[secondary]] legislation were annulled by the Minister of Health (see paragraphs 42 and 44 below), there would remain no obstacles to women receiving medical assistance during home births..  This request was refused by the Ministry on 16 October 2012 for the same reasons as those given to the [[first]] and [[second]] applicants (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above). Given that in her request the third applicant insisted on relying on the Court’s judgment in Ternovszky (cited above), the Ministry of Health consulted the Ministry of Justice on the matter. The Ministry of Justice noted that the Court had found a violation in the above‑mentioned case because of its very particular and specific circumstances, which had led the Court to conclude that the situation in Hungary, in as much as it related to healthcare professionals [[providing]] assistance during home births, was surrounded by legal uncertainty that gave rise to arbitrariness. Nonetheless, the Court had acknowledged that, as concerned the provision of healthcare [[services]], the States had a [[wide]] margin of appreciation, and regulation had to ensure a proper balance between societal interests and the right at [[stake]]. The Ministry of Justice pointed out that the Court’s judgment did not mean that a [[State]] was under a general obligation to establish a regulatory framework that would allow healthcare specialists to [[provide]] [[services]] to women giving birth at home. Taking into account the above, and given that Lithuanian law did not contain provisions regarding the provision of healthcare [[services]] to women giving birth at home, the Ministry concluded that a pregnant woman could not [[require]] that, upon her request, a healthcare institution or a healthcare specialist [[provide]] her with childbirth-related healthcare [[services]] outside a healthcare institution. Similarly, a healthcare institution or a specialist had no obligation to [[provide]] such [[services]], even if a pregnant woman so wished. That being so, the Ministry also emphasised that the third applicant was welcome to visit the maternity wards in Lithuania and to choose the one which had the environment that most suited her..  In her application to the Court of 19 October 2012, the third applicant, like the [[second]] applicant, [[stated]] that she was “firmly resolved to give birth at home, irrespective of whether she would receive qualified assistance during the birth”. She was due to give birth in March 2013..  After having lodged the instant application with the Court, the third applicant also started administrative court proceedings in respect of the Ministry’s refusal to grant her request for the changes in [[secondary]] legislation (see paragraphs 17 and 18 above)..  On 8 April 2013 the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court rejected the third applicant’s complaint. The court noted that there were no legal instruments explicitly regulating home births in Lithuania. [[Therefore]], the third applicant’s assertion that the two legal instruments adopted by the Minister of Health (see paragraphs 42 and 44 below) directly prohibited home birth was erroneous and unsubstantiated. Those legal instruments only regulated birth in hospitals, not home births..  On 22 January 2014 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the first-instance court’s decision. It rejected the third applicant’s argument that the absence of any legal regulation [[allowing]] the provision of healthcare [[services]] during home births constituted a breach of the right to respect for one’s private life. The court referred to [[Article]] 52 of the Law on the Healthcare [[System]] (see paragraph 39 below), which guaranteed a patient’s right to privacy. For the court, such legal regulation thus empowered the third applicant to give birth in a [[specialised]] medical institution of her choice, which was [[equipped]] in accordance with the [[requirements]] for such institutions, so that the health of the mother and the newborn would be protected and they could receive immediate high-quality and effective help, should any danger arise to their health or lives during childbirth. The Supreme Administrative Court held that such legal regulation [[maintained]] a balance between two constitutional values: privacy and the protection of health..  The Supreme Administrative Court also referred to the content of the Ministry of Health letter of 16 October 2012 (see paragraph 18 above), wherein that institution had reminded the third applicant that her family members could be [[present]] during the birth of her child and had offered her the opportunity to visit hospitals with maternity wards and to choose the most suitable one. Accordingly, the third applicant had the right and possibility, guaranteed by law, to choose the most suitable medical institution and to state her wishes regarding conditions of privacy and their scope (dėl privatumo sąlygų ir apimties). There was no information in the file to the effect that the third applicant had ever approached any of the maternity wards or that she had faced obstacles in choosing how to [[make]] use of that right to privacy (for example, by requesting certain [[services]], such as a private room) and then instituted court proceedings. [[One]] also had to bear in mind the fact that privacy in respect of the third applicant’s personal life (which she had sought by demanding to be [[provided]] with medical assistance during her home birth) could not be seen as having a [[greater]] value than the health of her and the newborn child, for the purpose of which the [[State]] had [[established]] a system of personal healthcare and qualified medical assistance..  The fourth applicant was born in 1975. She lives in Vilnius. The fourth applicant stated that she had given birth at home in 2001, 2003 and 2011, with the assistance of doula J.I.Š..  In her application to the Court the fourth applicant also stated that even though she was of “reproductive age”, she did not dare to become pregnant for the fourth time, owing to the charges pending in respect of J.I.Š., “while the issue of giving birth at home remained legally unregulated in Lithuania” (kol Lietuvoje nėra teisiškai sureguliuotas gimdymo namuose klausimas)..  In 2012 a non-governmental organisation for promoting childbirth at home, “gimimas.lt”, was [[established]]. In April 2012 it published an Internet press [[release]] calling on society and the [[State]] authorities, [[including]] the Ministry of Health, to discuss the question of home birth. The third and fourth applicants were among those who initiated that NGO and were its [[active]] participants..  In April 2012 the Association of Lithuanian Psychologists (Lietuvos psichologų sąjunga) asked the Ministry of Health to initiate changes in legislation to permit midwives and obstetrician-gynaecologists to [[provide]] medical assistance to women choosing to give birth outside hospital..  On 26 April 2012, at the Seimas, the Minister of Health was asked to comment about the possibility of [[providing]] medical assistance during home births. He replied that his opinion was categorical and negative; he also asked the non-governmental organisations that promoted that issue to be cautious and responsible. The Minister noted that at that time there were criminal investigations pending concerning “impostors” (apsišaukėliai) who had assisted with home births at which babies had died and mothers had suffered serious injuries. He pointed out that it was precisely owing to those criminal investigations that various requests concerning assistance for home births had started reaching the Ministry..  In April and May 2012 a group of non-governmental organisations asked the Lithuanian Midwives Association and the Lithuanian [[Fellowship]] of Midwives and Gynaecologists for their views on home birth.  In its written reply of 17 May 2012, the Lithuanian Midwives Association [[stated]] its disapproval of the prospect of midwives assisting with home births. On 19 June 2012 the Lithuanian [[Fellowship]] of Midwives and Gynaecologists replied that despite significant [[worldwide]] changes in the sphere of maternity care, the question of planned home births remained sensitive and controversial..  According to publicly available information, after the death of a baby born at home in June 2011, the police started a criminal investigation. Eventually, the authorities started examining the legality of the actions of a number of persons assisting with home births. The Government were informed by the police that in respect of those criminal proceedings the applicants only had the status of witnesses..  On an unspecified date the prosecutors started criminal proceedings under [[Article]] 202 of the Criminal Code (Unauthorised Engagement in an [[Economic]] Activity, see paragraph 48 below) in respect of doula J.I.Š., who, despite having no medical [[training]] whatsoever, between 1999 and 2011 on thirty-six occasions had assisted at home births. The scope of her actions at those home births had varied between merely examining newborn babies to [[performing]] certain childbirth-related actions..  By a judgment of 23 December 2016, the Vilnius City District Court acquitted J.I.Š., holding that she had revived the [[old]] profession of doula, which although not regulated in Lithuania, was also not forbidden by law. The court considered that since J.I.Š. had had no medical [[training]] and had not acted as an obstetrician-gynaecologist or as a midwife, or as a medical professional in general, she could not be liable under [[Article]] 202 § 2 of the Criminal Code..  On 19 July 2017 the Vilnius Regional Court overturned the lower court’s judgment and convicted J.I.Š. under [[Article]] 202 § 2 of the Criminal Code. The appellate court held that while taking part in home births J.I.Š. had been [[providing]] healthcare [[services]] that fell within the competence of an obstetrician-gynaecologist or a midwife, whereas J.I.Š. had neither a medical education nor a licence to [[provide]] such [[services]]. By [[acting]] in such a manner J.I.Š. had acted in breach of the [[existing]] legal regulations, under which the only specialists who could [[assist]] with births were obstetrician‑gynaecologists and midwives and birth with such assistance could take place (gimdymai priimami) only in a maternity ward. It followed that J.I.Š. had been engaged in prohibited medical activities. She was sentenced to six months of deprivation of liberty, suspended for one year..  J.I.Š. lodged an appeal on points of law..  By a ruling of 12 June 2018, an enlarged chamber (seven judges) of the Supreme Court noted that activities relating to home births, as a phenomenon, had been neither criminalised nor forbidden by law in Lithuania. Accordingly, the appellate court had erred in holding that J.I.Š. had been engaged in unauthorised professional activity, as understood under [[Article]] 202 § 2 of the Criminal Code. That notwithstanding, J.I.Š.’s activity, although it had not been prohibited (jos vykdyta veikla nėra uždrausta), had been unlawful (neteisėta). However, the Supreme Court found that the bill of indictment had failed to establish the precise amount of income that J.I.Š. had received for her activities. It was therefore impossible to establish the element of entrepreneurship, which was necessary in order to [[hold]] a person criminally liable under [[Article]] 202 § [[1]] of the Criminal Code. She therefore had to be acquitted.\n",

The Ministry of Justice noted that the Court had found a violation in the above‑mentioned case because of its very particular and specific circumstances, which had led the Court to conclude that the situation in Hungary, in as much as it related to healthcare professionals [[leave]] assistance during home births, was surrounded by legal uncertainty that gave rise to arbitrariness. Nonetheless, the Court had acknowledged that, as concerned the provision of healthcare [[serving]], the States had a [[blanket]] margin of appreciation, and regulation had to ensure a proper balance between societal interests and the right at [[bet]]. The Ministry of Justice pointed out that the Court’s judgment did not mean that a [[say]] was under a general obligation to establish a regulatory framework that would allow healthcare specialists to [[leave]] [[serving]] to women giving birth at home. Taking into account the above, and given that Lithuanian law did not contain provisions regarding the provision of healthcare [[serving]] to women giving birth at home, the Ministry concluded that a pregnant woman could not [[want]] that, upon her request, a healthcare institution or a healthcare specialist [[leave]] her with childbirth-related healthcare [[serving]] outside a healthcare institution. Similarly, a healthcare institution or a specialist had no obligation to [[leave]] such [[serving]], even if a pregnant woman so wished. That being so, the Ministry also emphasised that the third applicant was welcome to visit the maternity wards in Lithuania and to choose the one which had the environment that most suited her..  In her application to the Court of 19 October 2012, the third applicant, like the [[irregular]] applicant, [[declared]] that she was “firmly resolved to give birth at home, irrespective of whether she would receive qualified assistance during the birth”. She was due to give birth in March 2013..  After having lodged the instant application with the Court, the third applicant also started administrative court proceedings in respect of the Ministry’s refusal to grant her request for the changes in [[petty]] legislation (see paragraphs 17 and 18 above)..  On 8 April 2013 the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court rejected the third applicant’s complaint. The court noted that there were no legal instruments explicitly regulating home births in Lithuania. [[hence]], the third applicant’s assertion that the two legal instruments adopted by the Minister of Health (see paragraphs 42 and 44 below) directly prohibited home birth was erroneous and unsubstantiated. Those legal instruments only regulated birth in hospitals, not home births..  On 22 January 2014 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the first-instance court’s decision. It rejected the third applicant’s argument that the absence of any legal regulation [[tolerate]] the provision of healthcare [[serving]] during home births constituted a breach of the right to respect for one’s private life. The court referred to [[clause]] 52 of the Law on the Healthcare [[arrangement]] (see paragraph 39 below), which guaranteed a patient’s right to privacy. For the court, such legal regulation thus empowered the third applicant to give birth in a [[narrow]] medical institution of her choice, which was [[fit]] in accordance with the [[necessity]] for such institutions, so that the health of the mother and the newborn would be protected and they could receive immediate high-quality and effective help, should any danger arise to their health or lives during childbirth. The Supreme Administrative Court held that such legal regulation [[uphold]] a balance between two constitutional values: privacy and the protection of health..  The Supreme Administrative Court also referred to the content of the Ministry of Health letter of 16 October 2012 (see paragraph 18 above), wherein that institution had reminded the third applicant that her family members could be [[confront]] during the birth of her child and had offered her the opportunity to visit hospitals with maternity wards and to choose the most suitable one. Accordingly, the third applicant had the right and possibility, guaranteed by law, to choose the most suitable medical institution and to state her wishes regarding conditions of privacy and their scope (dėl privatumo sąlygų ir apimties). There was no information in the file to the effect that the third applicant had ever approached any of the maternity wards or that she had faced obstacles in choosing how to [[wee-wee]] use of that right to privacy (for example, by requesting certain [[serving]], such as a private room) and then instituted court proceedings. [[I]] also had to bear in mind the fact that privacy in respect of the third applicant’s personal life (which she had sought by demanding to be [[leave]] with medical assistance during her home birth) could not be seen as having a [[slap-up]] value than the health of her and the newborn child, for the purpose of which the [[say]] had [[plant]] a system of personal healthcare and qualified medical assistance..  The fourth applicant was born in 1975. She lives in Vilnius. The fourth applicant stated that she had given birth at home in 2001, 2003 and 2011, with the assistance of doula J.I.Š..  In her application to the Court the fourth applicant also stated that even though she was of “reproductive age”, she did not dare to become pregnant for the fourth time, owing to the charges pending in respect of J.I.Š., “while the issue of giving birth at home remained legally unregulated in Lithuania” (kol Lietuvoje nėra teisiškai sureguliuotas gimdymo namuose klausimas)..  In 2012 a non-governmental organisation for promoting childbirth at home, “gimimas.lt”, was [[plant]]. In April 2012 it published an Internet press [[spill]] calling on society and the [[say]] authorities, [[admit]] the Ministry of Health, to discuss the question of home birth. The third and fourth applicants were among those who initiated that NGO and were its [[alive]] participants..  In April 2012 the Association of Lithuanian Psychologists (Lietuvos psichologų sąjunga) asked the Ministry of Health to initiate changes in legislation to permit midwives and obstetrician-gynaecologists to [[leave]] medical assistance to women choosing to give birth outside hospital..  On 26 April 2012, at the Seimas, the Minister of Health was asked to comment about the possibility of [[leave]] medical assistance during home births. He replied that his opinion was categorical and negative; he also asked the non-governmental organisations that promoted that issue to be cautious and responsible. The Minister noted that at that time there were criminal investigations pending concerning “impostors” (apsišaukėliai) who had assisted with home births at which babies had died and mothers had suffered serious injuries. He pointed out that it was precisely owing to those criminal investigations that various requests concerning assistance for home births had started reaching the Ministry..  In April and May 2012 a group of non-governmental organisations asked the Lithuanian Midwives Association and the Lithuanian [[society]] of Midwives and Gynaecologists for their views on home birth.  In its written reply of 17 May 2012, the Lithuanian Midwives Association [[declared]] its disapproval of the prospect of midwives assisting with home births. On 19 June 2012 the Lithuanian [[society]] of Midwives and Gynaecologists replied that despite significant [[universal]] changes in the sphere of maternity care, the question of planned home births remained sensitive and controversial..  According to publicly available information, after the death of a baby born at home in June 2011, the police started a criminal investigation. Eventually, the authorities started examining the legality of the actions of a number of persons assisting with home births. The Government were informed by the police that in respect of those criminal proceedings the applicants only had the status of witnesses..  On an unspecified date the prosecutors started criminal proceedings under [[clause]] 202 of the Criminal Code (Unauthorised Engagement in an [[economic]] Activity, see paragraph 48 below) in respect of doula J.I.Š., who, despite having no medical [[prepare]] whatsoever, between 1999 and 2011 on thirty-six occasions had assisted at home births. The scope of her actions at those home births had varied between merely examining newborn babies to [[do]] certain childbirth-related actions..  By a judgment of 23 December 2016, the Vilnius City District Court acquitted J.I.Š., holding that she had revived the [[honest-to-goodness]] profession of doula, which although not regulated in Lithuania, was also not forbidden by law. The court considered that since J.I.Š. had had no medical [[prepare]] and had not acted as an obstetrician-gynaecologist or as a midwife, or as a medical professional in general, she could not be liable under [[clause]] 202 § 2 of the Criminal Code..  On 19 July 2017 the Vilnius Regional Court overturned the lower court’s judgment and convicted J.I.Š. under [[clause]] 202 § 2 of the Criminal Code. The appellate court held that while taking part in home births J.I.Š. had been [[leave]] healthcare [[serving]] that fell within the competence of an obstetrician-gynaecologist or a midwife, whereas J.I.Š. had neither a medical education nor a licence to [[leave]] such [[serving]]. By [[pretend]] in such a manner J.I.Š. had acted in breach of the [[survive]] legal regulations, under which the only specialists who could [[aid]] with births were obstetrician‑gynaecologists and midwives and birth with such assistance could take place (gimdymai priimami) only in a maternity ward. It followed that J.I.Š. had been engaged in prohibited medical activities. She was sentenced to six months of deprivation of liberty, suspended for one year..  J.I.Š. lodged an appeal on points of law..  By a ruling of 12 June 2018, an enlarged chamber (seven judges) of the Supreme Court noted that activities relating to home births, as a phenomenon, had been neither criminalised nor forbidden by law in Lithuania. Accordingly, the appellate court had erred in holding that J.I.Š. had been engaged in unauthorised professional activity, as understood under [[clause]] 202 § 2 of the Criminal Code. That notwithstanding, J.I.Š.’s activity, although it had not been prohibited (jos vykdyta veikla nėra uždrausta), had been unlawful (neteisėta). However, the Supreme Court found that the bill of indictment had failed to establish the precise amount of income that J.I.Š. had received for her activities. It was therefore impossible to establish the element of entrepreneurship, which was necessary in order to [[moderate]] a person criminally liable under [[clause]] 202 § [[unity]] of the Criminal Code. She therefore had to be acquitted.\n",

      "The applicant was born in Nigeria in 1975 and lives in Zölling.. In Nigeria, the applicant completed eleven years of schooling and subsequently held various jobs in Lagos. After leaving the country, he lived in Spain from 1994 to 1997, living at first on social security and later working as a day-labourer on several farms. In 1997 he arrived in Germany, where he applied for asylum under a different identity. His application was finally rejected in July 1998. He left Germany for Italy with a German national with whom he had started a relationship. In January 1999 he moved on to Spain, where he worked as a cook and waiter in various restaurants.. In October 2000 the applicant re-entered Germany. On 21 October 2000 his daughter, from his above-mentioned relationship, was born. The applicant’s daughter is a German national.. In 2000 and 2001 the applicant and the child’s mother lived together. From the outset they had, and continue to have, joint custody. On 11 December 2000, the Authority of the City of Munich issued the applicant a residence permit based on family ties, valid until 1 December 2001.. On 18 July 2001 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having committed an offence under the Narcotics Act (Betäubungsmittelgesetz)..  On 28 May 2002 the Munich Regional Court sentenced him to eight years’ imprisonment for drug trafficking on a large scale. It observed that the applicant had recruited and instructed the child’s mother as a drugs runner for two separate consignments of cocaine from South America to Europe in summer 1998 and in late 1999/early 2000. It considered, in favour of the applicant, that this was his first criminal conviction, that the first delivery had failed (the drugs did not actually enter the distribution system), and that the applicant had been detained on remand since July 2001. The Regional Court held against the applicant that he had used as drugs runners two young women who were adolescents at the time the offences were committed, and who ran the risk of a lengthy prison sentence in South America; that he had exploited the naivety of his daughter’s mother; that a large amount of cocaine was meant to be smuggled in the first case and that four kilograms of cocaine were smuggled into Europe in the second case; and that the entire undertaking had been handled very professionally. In addition, the Regional Court considered that a conviction for a third case of drug smuggling could not be envisaged for the sole reason that the precise amount of cocaine transported in a suitcase from Peru to Spain could not be determined..  The applicant submitted that his daughter and her mother had visited him in prison from 2001 to 2003 and that he had sought a court ruling on contact with his daughter, when the child’s mother discontinued the visits. On 4 July 2006, the applicant and the child’s mother agreed before the Munich Family Court that supervised meetings between him and his daughter would take place as soon as he was released from prison. As of 31 January 2008, the daughter visited the applicant regularly in prison – every four weeks for two hours at a time – in the company of a priest..  On 3 July 2009 the applicant was released, after having served his entire sentence. He was placed under supervision of conduct (Führungsaufsicht) until 3 July 2013..  After his release, the applicant was granted exceptional leave to remain (Duldung) under Section 60a of the Residence Act – according to the information available to the Court this was granted most recently in January 2017 and would last until July 2017. It meant that enforcement of the expulsion order was temporarily suspended, being impossible to execute as the applicant did not have a valid passport (see paragraphs 28, 29 and 36‑42 below). He began occupational re-training as a management assistant in marketing communication in April 2010, which he successfully completed in June 2012, but was not allowed to engage in gainful employment since his release..  The applicant has not lived with his daughter and her mother since his release. Since 2012 they have been living in different cities, with distances between their homes varying between thirty and seventy kilometres and the travelling time varying between forty minutes and one hour. The applicant sees his daughter on a regular basis and maintains close contact with her. It is not disputed between the parties that she spends every other weekend with him. According to a social worker’s statement, he has become an important contact person for her. Both the applicant’s daughter and her mother explicitly wish the applicant’s contact with his child to continue..  Since his release, the applicant was convicted of three offences by the Munich District Court, of fraud in 2011 and of theft in 2015 and 2016. He was sentenced to twenty, thirty and ninety day-fines, respectively. By being present on German territory without having a passport, he committed an ongoing offence under the Residence Act. Criminal proceedings in this connection were discontinued by the public prosecutor in November 2013 because the applicant’s guilt was considered to be of a minor nature and because prosecution was not in the public interest. The matter was referred to the administrative authority for treatment as an administrative offence..  On 21 March 2003 the Authority of the City of Munich refused to renew the applicant’s residence permit and ordered his expulsion. It held that the applicant’s expulsion was mandatory pursuant to Section 47 § 1 of the Aliens Act (Ausländergesetz; since 2004: Section 53 of the Residence Act) which foresaw the mandatory expulsion of an alien if he or she were sentenced to either at least three years’ imprisonment for a criminal offence, or to any period of imprisonment (not on probation) for an offence under the Narcotics Act. The authority examined whether the applicant enjoyed special protection against expulsion because he was the father of a German child. It found that the applicant had lived with his daughter only for a short time prior to his imprisonment, she had thus experienced separation from the applicant and that, in the light of the applicant’s very serious criminal offences, the State’s interest in removing the applicant prevailed over his interest in enjoying family life with his daughter. He could remain in contact with her by letter or telephone and could apply for permission to enter Germany for specific periods of time (Betretenserlaubnis). It considered that the applicant’s expulsion was in conformity with Article 8 § 2 of the Convention. This decision, which also contained an unlimited re-entry ban and notice that he would be deported to Nigeria if he did not leave Germany voluntarily within four weeks after being released from prison, became final on 26 August 2003..  On 15 November 2006, after the applicant had served more than two thirds of his prison sentence, the authorities envisaged his expulsion as of 1 November 2007..  On 3 December 2007 the applicant introduced another asylum application (see paragraph 6 above). On 8 February 2008, the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees dismissed his application as manifestly ill‑founded under Section 30 § 3 of the Asylum Procedure Act (see paragraph 33 below) and, finding that there were no impediments to his return to his country of origin, ordered his expulsion. The decision again contained notice that he would be deported to Nigeria if he did not leave Germany voluntarily within one week after the decision became final. On 6 March 2008, the Munich Administrative Court granted suspensive effect to the applicant’s appeal in the asylum procedure. On 8 September 2009 it dismissed his appeal in the main procedure, also finding, inter alia, that the applicant’s ties to his daughter could not be taken into account in the asylum procedure. This decision became final on 1 December 2009..  On 10 September 2009 the applicant applied for a residence permit based on family ties..  On 9 February 2010 the Authority of the City of Munich rejected his application, holding that there was a final expulsion decision (of 21 March 2003) against the applicant, which precluded granting him a residence permit. No impediments arose from the fact that his daughter was a German national. The applicant could maintain contact with her through letters, telephone calls and occasional visits. His daughter was accustomed to a long-distance relationship with him. He was responsible for the renewed separation and the purpose of the expulsion order had not yet been achieved. At the same time, it reduced the re-entry ban to five years and ruled that the applicant could, starting one year after his actual expulsion, apply for permission to enter Germany twice a year for a total of four weeks..  On 14 April 2010 the Munich Administrative Court quashed that decision and ordered the administrative authority to issue a residence permit. It noted that the applicant met the requirements for a residence permit based on family ties, but that granting such a permit was precluded by the final expulsion decision. However, the applicant was entitled to a residence permit on humanitarian grounds in accordance with Section 25 § 5 of the Residence Act, with the margin of appreciation inherent in this provision being reduced to zero. Section 11 § 1 of the Residence Act was not applicable to this provision and the applicant’s departure was impossible in law due to his family life with his daughter, which was protected, inter alia, by Article 8 of the Convention..  The Administrative Court found that, despite the serious nature of the criminal offences the applicant had committed, there was no public interest that outweighed the child’s best interests and the applicant’s interest in having contact with his daughter. The relationship between the applicant and his daughter had the quality of a “family” and their ties were of benefit to the child. It considered that they could only live together in Germany, as the child could not be expected to relocate to Nigeria; that the applicant had committed the criminal offences prior to the birth of his daughter; that he had made considerable efforts as a father, as was also evidenced by his choice to remain imprisoned in Germany and to have supervised meetings with his daughter as of January 2008 rather than having his sentence suspended and being expelled as of 1 November 2007; that the latter event marked a turning point, which occurred after the expulsion order had become final in 2003 and which had not been taken into account by the administrative authorities; that the child had already been deprived of a relationship with her father for many years during his imprisonment; that the material assessment with a view to the applicant’s expulsion had been conducted on 21 March 2003, years before the developments in the father‑daughter relationship and the moment the expulsion order would be enforced; and that the enforcement of the expulsion order in connection with a re-entry ban would deprive the child of the possibility of a normal father-daughter relationship for the remainder of her childhood..  On 27 June 2011 the Bavarian Administrative Court of Appeal overturned that judgment and denied the applicant’s right to a residence permit. It considered that his asylum application had been rejected as manifestly ill-founded under Section 30 § 3 of the Asylum Procedure Act and that, therefore, in accordance with Section 10 § 3, second sentence, of the Residence Act, he could not be granted a residence permit prior to leaving Germany (see paragraph 33 below). The exception to this rule, foreseen in the third sentence of this paragraph, was not applicable because the applicant did not have a claim to a residence permit within the meaning of that provision (see paragraph 34 below)..  First, a claim to a residence permit based on family ties under Sections 27 et seq. of the Residence Act was precluded by Section 11 of the Residence Act due to the final expulsion order of 21 March 2003 (see paragraph 35 below). Second, a claim to a residence permit on humanitarian grounds under Section 25 § 5 of the Residence Act was proscribed because the applicant did not have a valid passport, which was a general requirement for the granting of a residence permit (see paragraph 32 below). As the decision to waive this requirement in cases concerning residence permits on humanitarian grounds was a discretionary one, the applicant did not have a claim to a residence permit within the meaning of Section 10 § 3, third sentence, of the Residence Act, not even if the margin of appreciation were reduced to zero (see paragraph 34 below). Third, the court found that the applicant could not base a claim to a residence permit on impediments to his return to his country of origin either, referring to the outcome of the asylum proceedings in 2008 and 2009 (see paragraph 18 above). The Court of Appeal concluded that, under these circumstances, it was not decisive whether the ties between the applicant and his daughter were such that the requirements for a residence permit on humanitarian grounds under Section 25 § 5 of the Residence Act were met, if the applicant’s asylum application had not been dismissed, and refrained from elaborating on this aspect..  On 12 September 2011 the applicant lodged an action to be granted leave to appeal on points of law, arguing that his case raised a matter of fundamental importance. He submitted that he should be granted a residence permit under Section 25 § 5 of the Residence Act because, as the father of a minor child of German nationality for whom he had joint custody, he did, in principle, have a claim to a residence permit based on family ties. The purpose of Section 10 § 3 of the Residence Act was to sanction abuse of the asylum procedure, but an abusive asylum application should not bear negative consequences where the foreigner had a claim, within the meaning of that provision, to a residence permit. In that regard, it should be decisive whether or not the substantive requirements of the respective provision for a residence permit were met, as in his case with regard to the permit based on family ties, and that the reason for the claim not being realised, in his case the final expulsion order against him, should not be relevant..  On 16 February 2012 the Federal Administrative Court rejected the applicant’s action. It noted that, according to the case-law of the domestic courts, the exception foreseen in Section 10 § 3, third sentence, of the Residence Act only applied to claims that followed directly from legislative provisions and in respect of which all requirements, general and specific, were met. A residence permit based on family ties was precluded because of the final expulsion order against the applicant. Under these circumstances, granting a residence permit on humanitarian grounds was to be considered. However, as the applicant did not have a valid passport, which was a general requirement for the granting of a residence permit from which derogations were, in cases concerning Section 25 § 5 of the Residence Act, possible only by way of a discretionary decision, the exception foreseen in Section 10 § 3, third sentence, of the Residence Act was not applicable. The decision was served on the applicant on 22 February 2012..  On 22 March 2012 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Federal Constitutional Court, alleging that the decisions of the Administrative Court of Appeal and of the Federal Administrative Court violated his right to respect for his family life with his daughter. On 18 July 2012 the Federal Constitutional Court declined to accept the applicant’s constitutional complaint without providing reasons (no. 2 BvR 657/12)..  After the Authority of the City of Munich, on 12 June 2012, had ordered the applicant to present himself to the Embassy of Nigeria in Germany so that a passport for the upcoming expulsion could be issued, the applicant refused to do so and filed an action against this order with the Munich Administrative Court. During the court hearing on 1 August 2012, the applicant and the immigration authorities agreed to the following:\n",
      "“- The effect of the re-entry ban will be limited to two and a half years after leaving Germany.\n",
      "- The immigration authorities will give their consent for a visa to enter Germany based on family reunion. If the applicant by then still has joint custody with the child’s mother, a residence permit on the grounds of family ties will be issued. If the applicant no longer has joint custody for his daughter, the immigration authority will use its discretion regarding the issue of a residence permit in favour of the applicant.\n",
      "- All of this applies only if the applicant can show that he has not committed further criminal offences and if no other reasons for his expulsion emerge.\n",
      "- A time‑limit for leaving the country is set at 1 November 2012.”\n",
      "In the light of this agreement, the applicant withdrew his action, and the proceedings before the Munich Administrative Court were discontinued..  On 25 September 2012 the Embassy of Nigeria in Germany declared that it would not issue a passport to the applicant as long as the proceedings before this Court were pending. On 6 November 2012 the applicant informed the immigration authorities that he would not leave Germany, contrary to his initial plans and to his declaration before the Munich Administrative Court. As a result, the agreement concluded before that court became void.\n",

      "The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Ljubljana.. On 8 October 1992 the applicant became a member of L.E., which was at that time a public limited company operating under Slovenian law. The share capital of L.E. stood at 2,995,250 Slovenian tolars (SIT)[1] and the applicant’s capital contribution was SIT 332,805.55[2] (that is, 11.11% of the company’s share capital). L.E. had nine members in total.. On 2 February 1993 the applicant was employed by company L.E. as head of its IT department. In addition, he provided assistance to the finance director (bookkeeping)..  On 19 February 1993 two key members and directors of company L.E., Mr J. Za. and Mr M. D., died in a car accident. The first one, however, remained registered as a member of L.E. The shares of the second were taken over by Ms D. D. Two other members, Mr J. Zu. and Mr D. P., were seriously injured, but also remained registered as members of L.E. Following those events, the applicant assumed the role of acting director of L.E. on 29 April 1993, and then of managing director on 23 February 1995. In that capacity he acted as the company’s representative..  In 1993 the Slovenian Railways, a statutory company, initiated civil proceedings against L.E., claiming the payment of three sums arising from their business dealings, totalling approximately SIT 5,000,000. The applicant represented L.E. at all hearings held in that case except for the last hearing on 22 November 2000..  On 9 August 1995 Mr M. K., another member of L.E., died, but nevertheless remained registered as a member..  In November 1995 L.E. was aligned with the Companies Act 1993, as required (see paragraph 35 below), and at the same time converted from a public limited company into a limited liability company (see paragraph 33 below). At that time L.E. was already both illiquid and insolvent..  On 6 May 1996 the general meeting of L.E. dismissed the applicant from the post of managing director. Since the members failed to appoint a new director, as required (see paragraph 37 below), the applicant’s dismissal was not entered in the court register and he remained registered as managing director of L.E..  On 19 June 1997, on the applicant’s initiative, the general meeting of L.E. decided to start winding-up proceedings. The applicant made a winding-up petition on behalf of L.E. on 23 June 1997, declaring that the company had been insolvent for some time and that its total debt was SIT 22,393,952. On 16 July 1997 the competent court ordered L.E. to make, within 15 days, the required advance payment to cover the costs of the publication of the winding-up order in the Official Gazette in the amount of SIT 150,000[3]. The applicant alleged that some members of L.E. had refused to contribute to the advance payment and had preferred to wait for the competent court to wind up the company of its own motion, in accordance with the then applicable legislation (see paragraph 40 below)..  On 31 July 1997 the applicant stopped working for L.E..  On 25 September 1997 another member of L.E., Mr J. Zu., died, but nevertheless remained registered as a member..  On 15 October 1997 L.E.’s winding-up petition was rejected for failure to make the required advance payment..  By a judgment of 22 November 2000, the District Court of Ljubljana ordered L.E. to pay the Slovenian Railways the sums claimed plus interest (see paragraph 11 above). L.E. did not appeal; the judgment became final on 12 January 2001..  On the basis of notification from the competent authority that L.E. had not performed any transactions through its bank account in a period of twelve consecutive months, on 19 January 2001 the Ljubljana District Court – acting in its capacity as the registry court – initiated proceedings to strike off the company from the court register pursuant to the Financial Operations of Companies Act 1999 (hereinafter “the FOCA”; paragraphs 41-52 below)..  On the same day, the decision to initiate strike-off proceedings was entered in the court register. The decision was sent to the registered address of L.E., but since no representative of the company was there to receive it, a delivery slip was left in its mailbox, notifying the company that the relevant correspondence could be collected at the post office. On 12 February 2001 the decision was returned to the registry court with the information that the addressee had failed to collect it. The registry court then served it by posting it on its notice board, as provided for by domestic law..  No objection was made to the decision of 19 January 2001, either by L.E. or by its members. Consequently, on 11 May 2001 the registry court issued a decision to strike off L.E. from the court register. The decision was published in the Official Gazette on 30 May 2001[4]. The registry court also attempted to serve the decision on L.E. by sending it to the company’s address, but like the previous decision, it was returned on 4 June 2001 with the information that the addressee had failed to collect it. The decision was again posted on the registry court’s notice board. Neither company L.E. nor any of its members, who were entitled to lodge an appeal against the strike-off decision, appealed against the decision, so on 17 August 2001 it became final..  On 25 September 2001 L.E. was struck off from the court register and thus ceased to exist. Notification of the strike-off was published in the Official Gazette on 6 February 2002[5]. At the time of the strike-off, L.E. had nine registered members (including the applicant). The applicant stated that he had become aware that his company had been struck off on 22 December 2004, when a writ was served on him (see paragraph 24 below)..  On 5 April 2002 the above-mentioned creditor applied to the Ljubljana Local Court for the judgment mentioned in paragraph 19 above to be enforced. On 5 June 2002 the court issued a writ of execution, ordering the seizure and sale of all tangible movable property of the applicant and six other members of L.E. It later revoked the writ in respect of Mr J. Za., Mr M. K. and Mr J. Zu., as they had died (see paragraphs 10, 12 and 17 above). At the request of the creditor, on 30 November 2004 the court expanded the writ, ordering the payment of the judgment debt by direct deduction from the earnings of the applicant and of three other members of L.E. The writ was served on the applicant on 22 December 2004..  On 29 December 2004 the applicant lodged an objection to the writ, arguing that the Local Court had failed to establish his actual role in company L.E. or to acknowledge his status as a passive member (see paragraph 51 below), which would have exonerated him from liability for the debts of the company. He maintained that the creditor’s claim against the company had arisen before he had joined it. Moreover, the applicant was of the view that the onus was on the creditor to establish that he had been an active member of the company. Lastly, he applied for a stay of enforcement..  In its judgment of 12 March 2005, the Ljubljana Local Court found that the onus of proving his status as passive member was on the applicant and that he had failed to prove that he had not been an active member of L.E. The court established that with his 11.11% share in the company, the applicant had enjoyed the rights of a minority member, and furthermore, he had been employed by the company and actively involved in its management since April 1993. In his capacity as acting director and later managing director, he had been authorised to act on behalf of the company. Moreover, even after he had resigned as managing director, he had still been active in the running of the company and had also signed the winding-up petition. Lastly, the court considered that, as a minority member, the applicant could have and should have proposed the appointment of a new director at a general meeting of the company, since pursuant to domestic law all companies had to have a director. For those reasons, the applicant’s objection was rejected. The court also dismissed the applicant’s request for a stay of enforcement, as he had failed to demonstrate that the enforcement would have caused him irreparable or serious damage..  On 9 February 2006 the Ljubljana Higher Court rejected an appeal lodged by the applicant on essentially the same grounds as the first-instance court. It observed, inter alia, that the Constitutional Court had found the measure of lifting the corporate veil under the FOCA to be in line with the principle of the separation of a company’s assets from those of its members and thus consistent with the Constitution. The court considered it irrelevant whether the applicant had become a member of L.E. before or after the creditor’s claim had arisen. Having joined the company, he had assumed its assets as well as its liabilities. It further held that it was not decisive that the applicant had not remained a director of L.E. until the dissolution of that company. What was crucial was that the applicant had been actively involved in its management and that he had had the rights of a minority member pursuant to section 445 of the Companies Act 1993 (see paragraph 37 below). The court noted that, in contrast to section 6 of the Companies Act 1993 which required the creditors of a company to prove that a member of the company had abused the corporate form (see paragraph 34 below), the FOCA had introduced a “non-rebuttable” presumption that the members of a struck-off company were deemed to have undertaken joint and several liability for any outstanding debts of the company. In accordance with the Constitutional Court’s ruling, they could be exonerated from their personal liability only if they demonstrated that they were “passive members” of the company (see paragraphs 46 and 51 below). Lastly, the court took note of the fact that the applicant had indeed made a winding-up petition on behalf of L.E., but it considered this irrelevant because L.E. had at the time failed to make the required advance payment and the petition had therefore been rejected (see paragraphs 15 and 18 above)..  On 5 May 2006 the applicant lodged two constitutional complaints. In one of them, he complained that the decisions rendered in the strike-off proceedings against L.E. had been served on that company alone and not on him personally. In the other one, he complained about the outcome of the enforcement proceedings against him..  On 31 January 2007 the Constitutional Court rejected the applicant’s complaint regarding the strike-off proceedings. The decision was served on the applicant on 5 February 2007. It found that the applicant lacked legal interest in challenging those proceedings, since L.E. had already been struck off from the court register. Consequently, even a positive outcome of the constitutional complaint could not improve the applicant’s position..  On 9 July 2007 the Constitutional Court also rejected the complaint regarding the enforcement proceedings as manifestly ill-founded. It held that the lower courts had correctly applied the Constitutional Court’s criteria for differentiating between active and passive members to the applicant’s individual situation..  In 2010 the judgment of 22 November 2000 was enforced in part by direct deduction from the applicant’s salary. On 23 September 2011 the applicant reached an out-of-court settlement with the creditor and paid the agreed amount. The enforcement proceedings against the applicant were terminated on 28 September 2011. In total, the applicant paid EUR 32,795 to the Slovenian Railways. It is not clear how much other members of L.E. have paid to the Slovenian Railways in this connection.\n",

      "The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Louvencourt.. He was hired in 1976 by the French national railway company (Société nationale des chemins de fer – “the SNCF”), where he last worked as Deputy Head of the Amiens Regional Surveillance Unit. He stated that in 2007 he had complained to senior management about the conduct of one of his subordinates, who, he alleged, had used extreme language when addressing a colleague. The employee in question had then filed a complaint against him, following which the applicant had been charged with making false accusations. The applicant had subsequently been suspended from duty by the SNCF on grounds of that charge.. The proceedings were discontinued a few months later, whereupon the applicant notified his employers of his wish to be reinstated in his former post. He received a reply inviting him to consider appointment to another post, but maintained his original request.. On the day of his reinstatement, on 17 March 2008, the applicant found that his work computer had been seized. After being summoned by his superiors, he was informed on 5 April 2008 that the hard disk on the computer had been analysed and that “address change certificates drawn up for third persons and bearing the Lille General Security Service logo” had been found, as well as a large number of files containing pornographic images and films. It can be seen from the judgment of the Amiens Court of Appeal of 15 December 2010 (see paragraphs 14-15 below) that the person who had replaced the applicant during his suspension from post had found “documents which had caught his attention” on the computer, and that he had alerted his superiors in March 2007 and January 2008..  A request for a written explanation was sent to the applicant on 7 May 2008. He replied that in 2006, following problems with his personal computer, he had transferred the contents of one of his USB keys to his work computer. He added that the files containing pornographic material had been sent to him by people he did not know, via the SNCF’s Intranet..  The applicant was summoned to a disciplinary hearing, which took place on 21 May 2008. On 9 June 2008 he was informed by the “resources management director” of Amiens head office that a proposal had been made to dismiss him from the service and that he would be summoned to appear before the disciplinary board. The board convened on 15 July 2008..  On 17 July 2008 the SNCF regional director decided to dismiss the applicant from the service. His decision was worded as follows:\n",
      "“ ... the analysis of the files stored on the hard disk of [the applicant’s] work computer, used for his professional duties, contained the following:\n",
      "i) change of address certificate, signed in his name, certifying the transfer on 01/11/2003 of Ms Catherine [T.] to the Lille General Security Service; the original certificate, sent to ICF North-East enabled the notice period for vacating her flat to be shortened;\n",
      "ii) change of address certificate, bearing the Ministry of Justice logo, in the name of M. [S.-J.], governor of Fresnes Prison, certifying the transfer of M. [P.] Frédéric to Strasbourg Prison, from 1 November 2006;\n",
      "iii) draft documents drawn up in the name of Michel [V.], director of the SOCRIF, certifying his financial situation with regard to that company;\n",
      "iv) a very large number of files containing pornographic images and films (zoophilia and scatophilia).\n",
      "These facts are in breach of the special obligation of exemplary conduct inherent in the duties formerly performed by him within the General Security Service, and of the following provisions:\n",
      "i) Article 5.2 of the RH 0006 on the principles governing the conduct of SNCF officials;\n",
      "ii) the general security database RG 0029 (information systems security policy – user’s charter);\n",
      "iii) the RA 0024 “code of professional conduct” - conduct to be observed with regard to the company’s information system;\n",
      "iv) Article 441-1 of the Criminal Code.”.  On 28 October 2008 the applicant brought proceedings before the Amiens Industrial Tribunal (conseil des prud’hommes) seeking a ruling that he had been dismissed without genuine or serious cause. On 10 May 2010 the Industrial Tribunal held that the decision dismissing the applicant from the service had been justified and, accordingly, rejected his claims.. On 15 December 2010 the Amiens Court of Appeal upheld the substance of that judgment. It held, in particular, as follows:\n",
      "“ ... [The applicant] submitted that the SNCF had infringed his private life by opening, in his absence, files identified as personal in his computer.\n",
      "As a matter of policy, documents kept by employees in the company’s office, save those identified by them as personal, are presumed to be for professional use, meaning that the employer can have access to them in the employee’s absence.\n",
      "It can be seen from the report drawn up by the SEF that the pornographic photos and videos were found in a file called “fun” stored on a hard disk labelled “D:/personal data”.\n",
      "The SNCF explained, without being challenged, that the “D” drive was called “D:/data” by default and was traditionally used by staff to store their work documents.\n",
      "An employee cannot use an entire hard disk, which is supposed to record professional data, for his or her private use. The SNCF were therefore entitled to consider that the description “personal data” appearing on the hard disk could not validly prohibit their access to it. In any event, the generic term “personal data” could have referred to work files being personally processed by the employee and did not therefore explicitly designate elements relating to his private life. That had been the case here, moreover, since the analysis of the hard disk yielded numerous work documents (“LGV photos” file, “warehouse photos” ... .\n",
      "The term “fun”, moreover, does not clearly convey that the file in question is necessarily private. The term can denote exchanges between colleagues at work or work documents kept as “bloopers” by the employee. The employer also rightly pointed out that the user’s charter provided that “private information [had to] be clearly identified as such (“private” option in the Outlook criteria)” and that the same was true of the media receiving that information (“private” folder). The lower court was therefore correct in considering that the file had not been identified as personal.\n",
      "The same applies to the files containing the impugned certificates registered under the names “Fred [P.]”, “SOCRIF” and “Catherine”.”.  The Court of Appeal also held that the applicant’s dismissal from the service had not been disproportionate. It observed that both the SNCF’s Code of Professional Conduct and the internal rules provided that staff were required to use the computers provided to them for exclusively professional ends, with the occasional private use being merely tolerated. It found that the applicant had committed a “massive breach of those rules, going as far as using his work tools to produce a forged document”. In the court’s view, those acts had been particularly serious because, as an official responsible for general surveillance, he would have been expected to be of exemplary conduct..  The applicant appealed on points of law. He submitted, in particular, that there had been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention. The Social Division of the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal in a judgment of 4 July 2012. It held as follows:\n",
      "“ ... whilst files created by an employee with the assistance of the computer facilities supplied to him by his employer for work purposes are presumed to be professional in nature, meaning that the employer is entitled to open them in the employee’s absence, unless they are identified as personal, the description given to the hard disk itself cannot confer privacy on all the data contained in it. The Court of Appeal, which found that labelling the hard disk in the employee’s computer “D:/ personal data” could not enable him to use it for purely private purposes and prohibit access by the employer, drew the legitimate conclusion that the files in question, which had not been identified as “private” according to the recommendations of the IT charter, could be lawfully opened by the employer.\n",
      "The Court of Appeal, which found that the employee had stored 1,562 pornographic files representing a volume of 787 megabytes over a period of four years, and that he had also used his work computer to produce forged certificates, rightly held that such misuse of his office equipment in breach of the rules in force at the SNCF amounted to a breach of his contractual obligations. ...”.\n",

In its judgment of 12 March 2005, the Ljubljana Local Court found that the onus of proving his status as passive member was on the applicant and that he had failed to prove that he had not been an active member of L.E. The court established that with his 11.11% share in the company, the applicant had enjoyed the rights of a minority member, and furthermore, he had been employed by the company and actively involved in its management since April 1993. In his capacity as acting director and later managing director, he had been authorised to act on behalf of the company. Moreover, even after he had resigned as managing director, he had still been active in the running of the company and had also signed the winding-up petition. Lastly, the court considered that, as a minority member, the applicant could have and should have proposed the appointment of a new director at a general meeting of the company, since pursuant to domestic law all companies had to have a director. For those reasons, the applicant’s objection was rejected. The court also dismissed the applicant’s request for a stay of enforcement, as he had failed to demonstrate that the enforcement would have caused him irreparable or serious damage..  On 9 February 2006 the Ljubljana Higher Court rejected an appeal lodged by the applicant on essentially the same grounds as the first-instance court. It observed, inter alia, that the Constitutional Court had found the measure of lifting the corporate veil under the FOCA to be in line with the principle of the separation of a company’s assets from those of its members and thus consistent with the Constitution. The court considered it irrelevant whether the applicant had become a member of L.E. before or after the creditor’s claim had arisen. Having joined the company, he had assumed its assets as well as its liabilities. It further held that it was not decisive that the applicant had not remained a director of L.E. until the dissolution of that company. What was crucial was that the applicant had been actively involved in its management and that he had had the rights of a minority member pursuant to section 445 of the Companies Act 1993 (see paragraph 37 below). The court noted that, in contrast to section 6 of the Companies Act 1993 which required the creditors of a company to prove that a member of the company had abused the corporate form (see paragraph 34 below), the FOCA had introduced a “non-rebuttable” presumption that the members of a struck-off company were deemed to have undertaken joint and several liability for any outstanding debts of the company. In accordance with the Constitutional Court’s ruling, they could be exonerated from their personal liability only if they demonstrated that they were “passive members” of the company (see paragraphs 46 and 51 below). Lastly, the court took note of the fact that the applicant had indeed made a winding-up petition on behalf of L.E., but it considered this irrelevant because L.E. had at the time failed to make the required advance payment and the petition had therefore been rejected (see paragraphs 15 and 18 above)..  On 5 May 2006 the applicant lodged two constitutional complaints. In one of them, he complained that the decisions rendered in the strike-off proceedings against L.E. had been served on that company alone and not on him personally. In the other one, he complained about the outcome of the enforcement proceedings against him..  On 31 January 2007 the Constitutional Court rejected the applicant’s complaint regarding the strike-off proceedings. The decision was served on the applicant on 5 February 2007. It found that the applicant lacked legal interest in challenging those proceedings, since L.E. had already been struck off from the court register. Consequently, even a positive outcome of the constitutional complaint could not improve the applicant’s position..  On 9 July 2007 the Constitutional Court also rejected the complaint regarding the enforcement proceedings as manifestly ill-founded. It held that the lower courts had correctly applied the Constitutional Court’s criteria for differentiating between active and passive members to the applicant’s individual situation..  In 2010 the judgment of 22 November 2000 was enforced in part by direct deduction from the applicant’s salary. On 23 September 2011 the applicant reached an out-of-court settlement with the creditor and paid the agreed amount. The enforcement proceedings against the applicant were terminated on 28 September 2011. In total, the applicant paid EUR 32,795 to the Slovenian Railways. It is not clear how much other members of L.E. have paid to the Slovenian Railways in this connection.\n",

      "The case concerned the publication of a newspaper article on the website of The New York Times. In the article the applicant had been mentioned by name and, based on reports by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (hereinafter “the FBI”) and European law-enforcement agencies, the applicant’s alleged ties to Russian organised crime had been publicised. The applicant’s attempt to obtain an injunction order before the domestic courts had been unsuccessful.. The applicant was born in 1947 and lives in Düsseldorf. He is an internationally active entrepreneur in the media sector and chief executive officer of the media company Innova Film GmbH.. He also holds the position of Vice-President of the World Jewish Congress and President of the Jewish Confederation of Ukraine. In 2010 the former mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, publicly honoured the applicant for his efforts to improve American‑Russian relations.. On 12 June 2001, the daily newspaper The New York Times published an article about an investigation into corruption against R.L. A slightly changed version was also published on the newspaper’s website. The online version, which was the subject of the domestic proceedings (see paragraphs 12-20 below), reads, in so far as relevant, as follows (emphasis added and names abbreviated by the Court):\n",
      "“[L] Media Company Faces a Federal Inquiry\n",
      "By [R. B.]\n",
      "Published: June 12 2001\n",
      "WASHINGTON, June 10— A company owned by [R.L.], the cosmetics heir and former New York City mayoral candidate, is under investigation by federal prosecutors over allegations that it paid at least $1 million in bribes to Ukrainian officials for a valuable television license, according to lawyers and Justice Department documents.\n",
      "The United States attorney in Manhattan, [M.W.], has empaneled a grand jury and issued subpoenas, and prosecutors are studying some 6,000 pages of documents from Central European Media enterprise, which [R.L.] founded in 1991 as part of a plan to build a media empire in Europe. It now owns television stations in several Central and Eastern European countries.\n",
      "In a Federal District Court filing in New York last year, [M.W.] sought the corporate documents, saying that they were needed for a criminal investigation into whether [R.L.]´s Central European Media had ‘made corrupt and unlawful payments to Ukrainian officials’ in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the federal law that prohibits American companies from paying bribes abroad. [R.L.] and the company did not challenge the request and turned over the documents, a lawyer said.\n",
      "The payments being examined took place in 1996 after Ukraine´s licencing body granted a potentially lucrative licence to [R.L.]´s company despite the fact that the Ukraine Parliament had imposed a ban on new licences.\n",
      "...\n",
      "In Ukraine, Central European Media controls the most popular station through its majority-owned subsidiary Studio 1 + 1.\n",
      "Prosecutors are studying two transactions related to Central European Media’s Ukraine investment, according to documents and persons close to the investigation. In one, prosecutors are trying to determine if L’s company paid $1.2 million to two Lebanese businessmen living in Ukraine, who then distributed it to some members of Ukraine’s television licensing board.\n",
      "... [R.L.]’s bid to gain the television license in Ukraine began in 1995. That year, he met in New York with [O.V.], a top adviser to Ukraine President [L.K.], to discuss business opportunities.\n",
      "The initial meetings between [R.L.] and his representatives and [O.V.] were not promising. ...\n",
      "[O.V.] suggested that [R.L.] team up with a new Ukrainian television broadcasting company, Studio 1 + 1, in Kiev, and he did. The principal owners were [V.R.] and Boris Fuchsmann, well known around Kiev for their influence and wealth. Less well known were their ties to Russian organized crime, according to reports by the F.B.I. and European law enforcement agencies.\n",
      "[V.R.], who no longer has an interest in 1 + 1, has denied any links to Russian organized crime. Mr. Fuchsmann did not respond to e-mail inquiries seeking comment on the licensing deal and the F.B.I.’s claim of his ties to organized crime, although an assistant confirmed that he had received the inquiries.\n",
      "A 1994 F.B.I. report on Russian organized crime in the United States described Mr. Fuchsmann as a gold smuggler and embezzler, whose company in Germany was part of an international organized crime network. He is barred from entering the United States.\n",
      "...\n",
      "Besides Mr. Fuchsmann and [V.R.], there were other, silent owners of Studio 1 + 1. In one internal fax, in April 1996, [J] described the Studio 1 + 1 shareholders as ‘‘extremely powerful’ people whom, she added, ‘I will not mention on this fax.’\n",
      "Central European Media now owns 60 percent of Studio 1 + 1, and Mr. Fuchsmann owns at least 30 percent, according to public statements.\n",
      "At the time it went into business with Mr. Fuchsmann and [V.R.], Central European Media did not conduct investigations into their backgrounds, according to a report by [R.L.]’s New York law firm, [D.&P.].\n",
      "In their 20-page report, which the prosecutors now have, the firm’s lawyers said that [R.L.] had been justified in dealing with Mr. Fuchsmann and [V.R.] because they had been highly recommended by [O.V.], whom the lawyers described as ‘an ardent supporter of free-market business’.\n",
      "The lawyers also concluded that Central European Media had not engaged in any illegal or improper activities. They said they could not rule out the possibility that Studio 1 + 1 had made improper payments, though they did not believe it had.\n",
      "The Ukraine’s television licensing board issued a broadcast license to Studio 1 + 1 not only in spite of Parliament’s moratorium, but with only four of the board’s eight members present; the law required at least six members for a vote.\n",
      "A few days after the license was issued, Central European Media transferred $1.4 million to International Teleservices of Belize, according to a C.M.E. Wire Transfer Request. That is the second transaction being looked at by prosecutors.\n",
      "The Belize company was indirectly owned by ‘many high Ukrainian officials,’ according to a second C.M.E. document, which did not name them.\n",
      "A third document shows that International Teleservices had paid this amount to a company in Germany owned by Mr. Fuchsmann, Innova, and that Innova had paid the license fees on behalf of Studio 1 + 1. Innova is part of a Russian organized crime network, according to U.S. and German law enforcement reports.\n",
      "It is not clear why such a circuitous route was used, and a person involved in the transaction, with inside knowledge of the owners of International Teleservices, said the $1.4 million payment was not for a license fee. He would not say what it was for.\n",
      "Central European Media officials were nervous about the license they won, and sought the opinion of two law firms in Kiev. Both acknowledged ‘the potential weaknesses’ of the broadcasting license, according to a C.M.E. document. One week later, O.V. had secured a letter from the Ukrainian justice ministry stating that the license was valid.\n",
      "Federal prosecutors, who opened their case in the wake of a number of private lawsuits challenging the legitimacy of the license award, have been examining documents for nearly a year, and the exact status of the investigation is not clear.”.  On 28 May 2001, before publication of the article, the journalist had notified the applicant, via an email to one of his employees, of the planned publication and had asked several questions. On 30 May 2001 the journalist had made a follow-up telephone call to the employee, who confirmed that the applicant had received the questions. However, the applicant refrained from answering the questions or commenting on the planned publication..  Since 12 June 2001 the article, showing the date of first publication, is retrievable from the website of The New York Times. It can also be found through online search engines such as “Google” or “Bing”..  On 31 July 2002 the applicant sought injunctions against certain parts of the article (highlighted in the article, see paragraph 9 above), published in the print and online versions..  On 9 January 2008 the Düsseldorf Regional Court declared the applicant’s action inadmissible due to lack of international jurisdiction on the part of the German courts. It found that, at the material time, the print version of The New York Times was not distributed in Germany and that the Internet version of the newspaper was not directed at a readership in Germany. The Düsseldorf Court of Appeal confirmed that decision by its judgment dated 30 December 2008. On 2 March 2010 the Federal Court of Justice quashed the part of the decision regarding the applicant’s claim for an injunction against the challenged statements in the online version of the article and referred that part of the action back to the Court of Appeal. The court held that the online version of the newspaper was accessible from Germany, and because it mentioned a German businessman in the article, the publication had a direct connection with Germany and German jurisdiction. It therefore affirmed the international jurisdiction of the German courts in that respect..  On 22 June 2011 the Court of Appeal decided on the part of the dispute which had been referred back to it by the Federal Court of Justice. It granted the injunction in so far as the article stated that the applicant had been banned from entering the United States, and dismissed the remainder of the applicant’s action for lack of merit. The Court of Appeal held that German law was applicable with regard to the online publication, as the article was accessible in Germany via the Internet and therefore the alleged violation of the applicant’s reputation had at least occurred in Germany..  The court accepted that the statements interfered with the applicant’s reputation and personality right (allgemeines Persönlichkeitsrecht) as protected by Article 2 § 1 and Article 1 § 1 of the Basic Law (Grundgesetz). However, as the statements had been made in the press, which was constitutionally protected pursuant to Article 5 § 1 of the Basic Law, it was necessary to balance both interests. Moreover, as the statements concerned a suspicion against the applicant, the presumption of innocence arising from Article 6 § 2 of the Convention and from German law also had to be taken into account. The court held that there was in principle a public interest in reporting on criminal offences, including the suspicion of their commission. On the other hand, continued the court, the interference with the rights of personality associated with such reporting required higher standards of care for newspaper reporting, because even if the investigation was later discontinued, “something of the accusation might stick to the person affected”. Therefore, concrete, provable connecting facts which go beyond a vague, intangible suspicion were required, the reporting must concern an incident of great weight and the suspicion must be identified as such. In addition, the reporting must be balanced, the journalist must not fail to report on exculpatory circumstances and the person concerned must, as a rule, be invited to make his own comments before publication..  As regards the statements at issue, the Court of Appeal held that there was a great informational interest on the part of the public in the reporting that the applicant, as a German businessman internationally active in the media sector, was suspected by the secret service of being involved in gold smuggling, embezzlement and organised crime. This assessment was not changed by the fact that the applicant had been mentioned by name in the article, or by the fact that when the article was published in 2001, the criminal offences mentioned therein had occurred more than sixteen years previously. Regarding the latter the court pointed out that the criminal offences had become relevant again, due to new suspicions regarding the involvement of a former mayoral candidate. For the understanding of these suspicions it had been necessary to elaborate on the companies and individuals, including the applicant, involved in the alleged corruption. Similarly, describing the suspected criminal backgrounds of some of the persons involved had been necessary for the readers’ comprehension of the allegation. The court also took into account that the article remained accessible in an online archive of the daily newspaper. It held that there was a recognised public interest not only in information on current events but also in being able to research events from recent history..  The court further considered that the reporting was free from polemic statements and insinuations, and made it sufficiently clear that only insights from FBI reports and the law-enforcement authorities were being reported. This was expressly pointed out in the challenged article with the words, \"according to reports by the F.B.I. and European law enforcement agencies\". The internal FBI report was confirmed by reports of several other law-enforcement agencies, and the applicant himself, while denying any criminal activities, confirmed certain facts mentioned in those reports during the proceedings. Furthermore, the author of the article had notified the applicant via email that the article would be published. In that context the court also considered that although the applicant had been aware of the defendant’s reporting even before the article had been published, he had waited for more than one year before applying for an injunction against the defendant. Therefore, the applicant had not perceived the interference with his personality right as intolerable..  In sum, the court concluded that the defendant had complied with the required journalistic duty of care and that the reporting had relied on sources and background information, which the journalist could reasonably consider reliable. Therefore, the informational interest of the public outweighed the concerns of protecting the applicant’s personality right, even taking into account that such reporting might seriously damage his private and professional reputation. Regarding the alleged entry ban, the court concluded that there had been no reliable sources and that the applicant had shown that he had recently travelled to the United States..  On 2 October 2012, the Federal Court of Justice rejected a complaint lodged by the applicant against the Court of Appeal’s refusal to grant leave to appeal on points of law..  On 26 April 2013 the Federal Constitutional Court declined to consider a constitutional complaint (no. 1 BvR 2387/12) lodged by the applicant, without providing reasons.\n",

      "The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Chişinău.. The applicant had a dispute with H. over ownership of a house. He brought a claim against H. seeking acknowledgement of his property rights, as his father’s heir, and H.’s eviction from the house. H. lodged a counterclaim, seeking acknowledgement of her property rights to the house as she had built it.. On 20 December 2007 the Buiucani District Court dismissed H.’s counterclaim and allowed the applicant’s claim in full. H. lodged an appeal. On 20 May 2008 the Chișinău Court of Appeal upheld the earlier judgment and dismissed H.’s appeal. H. did not attend the appellate hearing, even though the summons had been repeatedly sent to the address she had provided in her appeal. A registered letter was returned with a note stating that H. did not live at the address indicated by her. The judgment became final after the expiry of the two-month time-limit for lodging an appeal on points of law.. On 11 May 2009 H. lodged an appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court of Justice, stating that she had only learned of the judgment of 20 May 2008 on 23 April 2009. In her application, she indicated the same address as in the proceedings before the Court of Appeal. The applicant asked the Supreme Court of Justice to dismiss the appeal as being lodged outside the legal time-limit. He submitted that since it had been H. who had lodged the appeal with the Chişinău Court of Appeal, it had been her duty to enquire about the progress of the proceedings and not to wait for a year before doing so.. On 16 October 2009 the Supreme Court of Justice allowed H.’s appeal on points of law, quashed the previous judgments and delivered a new judgment on the merits of the case dividing the disputed house into equal shares between the applicant and H. The court argued that the appeal had not been lodged outside the time-limit because H. had not attended the hearing before the Court of Appeal and there was nothing in the file to suggest that that court had informed her of the availability of the full judgment. The court concluded that without any evidence of the date when H. had learned of the judgment, her appeal was considered to have been submitted on time. The judgment was final.\n",

      "The applicant was born in 1939 and lives in Sofia.. The applicant owns one half of a plot of land in the village of Golyamo Buchino, close to the city of Pernik. He also owned one half of a house standing on the plot, in which he lived until 1997, and one half of two smaller buildings, a barn and a pen. Those buildings no longer exist.. On an unspecified date towards the end of the 1980s or the beginning of the 1990s the State took a decision to create an opencast coalmine near the village. In a decision of 8 May 1990 the local mayor expropriated about ninety properties in the area for that purpose, including the applicant’s land and buildings.. The expropriation decision stated that the applicant should receive in compensation another plot of land in the village. The applicant received additionally a sum of money (the parties have not presented the decision of the mayor on the additional compensation). The majority of the remaining owners received either monetary compensation or flats in the city of Pernik. As another plot was not provided to the applicant within the statutory time‑limit of one year, on 21 August 1992 he requested that the expropriation be cancelled, as he was entitled to under section 102 of the Property Act (see paragraph 24 below). Another person who was due a plot of land in compensation also applied to have the expropriation of her property cancelled. In a decision of 2 October 1992 the Pernik regional governor cancelled the two expropriations, noting that the plots of land due in compensation had not been provided “owing to the impossibility for the municipality to ensure such plots”. The decision stated furthermore that the owners had to pay back the monetary compensation they had additionally received. On 22 December 1993 the applicant paid back that compensation.. The applicant remained in his house. In the years which followed the mine approached the house, due to its gradual enlargement. Coal was extracted from it by means of detonations, which, according to the applicant, shook the house on a daily basis. On unspecified dates cracks appeared on the walls of the house, and the barn and the pen collapsed. Towards the beginning of 1997 the applicant’s family moved out of the house, judging it too dangerous to stay..  Subsequently, the applicant contacted the mine, seeking to obtain compensation, but the negotiations failed. At the time, the mine was managed by a company which was wholly State-owned. In 2005 it was privatised..  In 2001 the applicant brought a tort action against the company operating the mine, seeking compensation for the damage caused to his property..  The Pernik Regional Court (“the Regional Court”), which examined the case at first instance, heard a witness, a neighbour of the applicant, who stated during a court hearing of 13 December 2001 that the walls of the applicant’s house were cracked, that its state continued to deteriorate, and that the barn had collapsed three or four years earlier. He thought that the house had been well constructed, and explained that after the initial damage the applicant had attempted to repair it. On 7 March 2002 the Regional Court heard another witness, who stated that most of the damage to the applicant’s house had been caused three or four years earlier..  The Regional Court appointed an expert, who established that the house had been constructed between 1948 and 1950, when there had been no requirements as to seismic resistance. At the time of drawing up the expert report the house was uninhabitable, as its walls were bent and cracked, with the cracks sometimes reaching 20-35 cm in width. The distance between the house and the mine’s periphery was about 160‑180 metres. This meant that the house was situated well inside the so‑called “sanitation zone” consisting of land within 500 metres of the mine’s edge, inside which the law prohibited any dwellings. The “security zone” for the mine, within which no unauthorised person was to be present during detonation works, had a radius of 600 metres. The expert confirmed his conclusions at a court meeting on 24 January 2002..  In a judgment of 27 June 2003 the Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s action. It considered it established that the applicant’s property had been seriously damaged and that the damage had coincided in time with the beginning of detonation works in the mine. Still, it concluded that the applicant had not proven that a causal link existed between the damage and the detonations. He had relied in that regard on the witness testimony provided by two neighbours, but according to the Regional Court it was impossible to establish what had caused the damage to the property by way of witness testimony. The burden of proof to establish such a circumstance lay on the applicant and the other party had argued that the damage had been due to the manner of construction of his house..  The applicant lodged an appeal. Before the Sofia Court of Appeal (“the Court of Appeal”) he called an additional witness, who stated during a hearing on 2 February 2004 that many houses in the area had already collapsed, and that all the other houses in the applicant’s neighbourhood had cracks..  On 25 June 2004 the Court of Appeal upheld the Regional Court’s judgment, confirming its reasoning. It held that while witness testimony could establish the extent and the timing of the damage to the applicant’s property, it could not prove the causal link between that damage and the detonation works at the mine..  The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. In a judgment of 5 April 2006 the Supreme Court of Cassation quashed the Court of Appeal’s judgment and remitted the case for fresh examination. It was of the view that the lower courts had not duly accounted for the fact that the mine operated in a prohibited area close to the applicant’s house, the house being situated within both the “sanitation zone” and the “security zone” around the mine. The lower courts had had to examine this fact in light of the statements of the witnesses, which had “established the circumstance” that the damage to the applicant’s property had been the result of the detonation works. It was also necessary to assess compliance by the company operating the mine with other statutory requirements, such as those concerning environmental protection..  After the case was remitted, the Court of Appeal commissioned a new expert report. The expert noted that, owing to the passage of time and the destruction of some documents, it was impossible to determine the exact distance between the applicant’s house and the area where the detonations had been carried out in 1997. Nevertheless, it was clear that the house had been well inside the “sanitation zone” around the mine. The expert additionally noted that the detonations had been carried out by qualified workers, in accordance with the mine’s internal rules..  The Court of Appeal heard an additional witness for the applicant, who stated during a court hearing of 23 November 2006 that many houses in the village had collapsed, and that he thought that this was due to the detonations at the mine. He added that the detonations took place on a daily basis, that they caused “earthquakes”, and that the houses shattered as a result. The first cracks on the applicant’s house had appeared even before the time when the mine had operated closest to it. The witness was not aware of any landslides in the area..  In a judgment of 2 April 2007 the Court of Appeal once again upheld the Regional Court’s judgment of 27 June 2003, dismissing the applicant’s claim. It found it “indisputable” that employees of the mine had acted in breach of law, by carrying out detonations in a prohibited area close to residential buildings, including at the time when, according to the applicant, the damage to his property had started. Nevertheless, on the basis of the material submitted, the applicant had not proved the causal link between the mine’s work and the damage to his property. The Court of Appeal reasoned in that regard:\n",
      "“The causal link ... cannot be assumed – it is to be fully proven by the claimant. It has not been shown in the case that the claimant’s building, constructed in the 1950s, has been damaged precisely because of the detonation works at the mine. The claimant has not shown that the residential building and the auxiliary buildings, given [their] manner of construction, the materials [used] and the time of [their] construction, would not have been damaged, or would not have been damaged to such an extent, had it not been for the detonation works at the mine. It has not been shown whether and to what degree the buildings’ state described by the expert [heard by the Regional Court] was due to normal wear and tear, taking into account the year [they were built] and the manner of [their] construction, and any lack of maintenance by the owner after the 1990 expropriation.”.  Upon a further appeal by the applicant, in a final judgment of 3 July 2008 the Supreme Court of Cassation upheld the Court of Appeal’s judgment, affirming its conclusions. It pointed out in particular that the expert report presented to the Court of Appeal (see paragraph 18 above) had only established that the applicant’s property had been situated within the “sanitation zone” around the mine, but “was insufficient to prove the existence of a causal link between the damage ... and the unlawful behaviour of employees of the respondent company”..  In the meantime, the applicant’s house has collapsed and no longer exists. The property has been abandoned.\n",

      "The first, second and third applicants were born in 1971, 1947 and 1954 respectively, and live in Budapest.. The second and third applicants, as well as the legal predecessors of the first and third applicant (Ms Róbertné Hidas and Ms Miklósné Kecskés) and other persons were co-owners of a plot of land of 4,847 sq. m (land registry title no. 223591) in District XXII of Budapest. They also co‑owned a neighbouring plot of land of 423 sq. m (land registry title no. 223592).. On 19 January 1998 the Budapest District XXII Mayor’s Office (hereafter “the local authority”) ordered the partition of plot no. 223591 into two plots measuring 1,519 sq. m and 3,328 sq. m. In the same decision, it requisitioned (lejegyzés) the plot of 1,519 sq. m for the purpose of constructing a local public road and awarded compensation of 5,511,000 Hungarian forints (HUF – approximately 25,000 European Currency Units (ECU) (the predecessor to the euro) at the material time), to be distributed among the owners in proportion to their ownership shares.. At the same time, the local authority also partitioned plot no. 223592 and requisitioned a part of that land with an area of 123 sq. m in exchange for compensation of HUF 376,200 (approximately ECU 1,700).. The decisions were served on the first applicant’s legal predecessor, the second applicant, the third applicant and the third applicant’s legal predecessor, among other persons. They appealed against it.. On 6 March 1998 the Budapest Public Administration Office (Budapest Főváros Közigazgatási Hivatala) upheld the first-instance decisions, which thus became final..  On 25 March 1998 the local authority entered into possession of the requisitioned plots of land and paid the compensation to the applicants, who only provisionally accepted the sum, while reserving their right to bring court proceedings against the requisition orders..  On 13 April 1998 some of the above-mentioned owners challenged the administrative decisions in court. The legal predecessor of the first applicant and the second applicant himself were parties to the proceedings, but not the third applicant or his legal predecessor..  On 16 March 2005, following two remittals ordered by the Budapest Court of Appeal, the Budapest High Court delivered a first-instance judgment and dismissed the claim..  On 30 November 2005 the Budapest Court of Appeal overturned the first-instance judgment and ordered new administrative proceedings. It held that the local authority’s decision had been tainted by a procedural irregularity, in that the local authority’s notary (who had adopted the decision of 19 January 1998) should have abstained from taking a decision in a case in which the local authority employing him had been one of the interested parties..  Accordingly, the Budapest District XI Mayor’s Office was appointed to conduct new first-instance administrative proceedings. On 7 February 2008 it adopted a decision identical to that of 19 January 1998 (see paragraph 7 above)..  On 2 July 2008 the decision was upheld on appeal by the Public Administration Office of Budapest, with an amendment that the compensation figures should be increased by accrued interest..  On 27 August 2008 the first applicant challenged the new administrative decision in court. The second and third applicants intervened (beavatkozó) in the proceedings in support of the first applicant..  On 11 March 2010 the Budapest High Court found for the applicants, quashed the administrative decision because it had been adopted on the basis of a legal provision previously annulled by the Constitutional Court, and ordered new proceedings..  On 10 January 2015 the Budapest Government Office (Budapest Főváros Kormányhivatala) adopted a new administrative decision, with the same content as before, but on different legal grounds..  On 9 February 2015 the applicants brought court proceedings against that decision..  On 19 April 2016 the Budapest Administrative and Labour Court delivered its judgment. It dismissed the applicants’ action as far as the requisition’s lawfulness was concerned but quashed the administrative decision as regards the compensation amount. It held that the compensation amount should be set at such sum as reflected by an assessment of the value of the properties as at 2015 and that the assessment should be carried out in accordance with the provisions of Government Decree no. 58/2015 (III.24). The government decree in question contained a table for the purposes of calculating social security pensions. In that table, different multiplication factors were associated with different years (from 1950 onwards), making it thus possible to calculate the current value of salaries and incomes received during previous employment..  On 14 June 2017 the Kúria quashed the final judgment and remitted the case to the Budapest Administrative and Labour Court for the recalculation of the compensation amount. It held that the method of assessing the valuations applied in the first-instance judgment could not be used in the context of the case; instead, the amount to be paid should be calculated by an expert on the basis of the properties’ market values on 10 January 2015, from which the compensation already received in 1998 (see paragraph 10 above) should be deducted..  Throughout the court proceedings, the Land Registry has retained a record of the dispute (perfeljegyzés)..  The public road contemplated by the local authority’s requisition order of 1998 (see paragraph 7 above) has yet to be constructed. At the date of the latest information available to the Court (2 October 2018), the proceedings concerning the amount of compensation due to the applicants were still pending before the domestic courts.\n",

      "The list of applicants is set out in the appended tables.. The applicants were employees of a municipal education institution.. On 13 June 2001 they brought proceedings before the Kolomna Town Court of the Moscow Region (“the Town Court”) against their employer and the town administration seeking recovery of unpaid wages and taxes to various social funds.. On 13 July 2004 the Kolomna Town Court issued a first-instance judgment on the merits of the case. On 22 September 2004 the Moscow Regional Court quashed the judgment on appeal and remitted the case for a fresh examination.. On 7 July 2005 the Town Court granted the applicants’ claims awarding each of them a certain amount against their employer (see Appendix I). The judgment was upheld on appeal by the Moscow Regional Court on 28 September 2005..  Between 26 June 2001 and 7 July 2005 the court hearings were adjourned twenty-five times due to the respondents’ or one of the respondents’ failure to appear, eighteen times on the claimants’ request and eleven times pursuant the requests by the defendants; four times the first‑instance court adjourned the case as the respondent authorities had been requested to submit additional documents. Moreover, on 11 June 2002 the proceedings were suspended pursuant to a decision by the domestic court on account of the claimants’ alleged failure to appear; on 4 February 2003 that decision was quashed by the appeal court, due to the first-instance court’s failure to notify the applicants of the hearing date. Thus, the period attributable to the authorities amounts to over one year..  On an unspecified date in 2005 the employer institution was liquidated. On 18 October 2005 the relevant record was made into the State Register of Legal Entities..  According to the Government’s submissions of 19 July 2011, on 30 June 2006 the judgment of 7 July 2005 was partially enforced in respect of certain applicants, as specified in Appendix I.\n",

      "The applicants are owners of residential buildings or apartments which were subject to the rent-control scheme. Under the relevant legislation they were obliged to let their flats to tenants while charging no more than the maximum amount of rent fixed by the State. The legislation precluded them from unilaterally terminating the leases or selling the flats in question to anyone other than the respective tenants. The particulars of the flats affected by the rent control are set out in Appendices 10 ‑ 17 (columns A ‑ F).. The situation of the applicants is structurally and contextually the same as that of the applicants in Bittó and Others v. Slovakia (no. 30255/09, 28 January 2014 (merits) and 7 July 2015 (just satisfaction)), and subsequently decided cases concerning the rent-control scheme in Slovakia (see Krahulec v. Slovakia, no. 19294/07; Bukovčanová and Others v. Slovakia, no. 23785/07; Rudolfer v. Slovakia, no. 38082/07, 5 July 2016; Riedel and Others v.

Slovakia [Committee], nos. 46609/13, 9892/14, 27 June 2017)..  Two residential building at 27 Panenská St. and 14 Konventná St. in Bratislava were acquired in 2002 by a religious organisation with legal personality, Cirkevný zbor Evanjelickej cirkvi Augsburského vyznania na Slovensku Bratislava (hereinafter “the Bratislava Evangelical Church”). This body established three other entities with legal personalities, including the applicant organisation the Old Town Evangelical Church..  The property in question was conveyed by the Bratislava Evangelical Church to the Old Town Evangelical Church by way of donation on 6 February 2013. On 15 February 2013 the previous owner ceased legally to exist and was legally succeeded by the Old Town Evangelical Church and the other two entities..  On 22 February 2012 the Old Town Evangelical Church gave formal notices of termination of their lease to the two tenants residing in flat no. 11 situated in the residential building at 27 Panenská St. in Bratislava. By law, these tenants had under certain circumstances the right to claim that the municipality provide them with a substitute flat on the termination of their lease. They did not avail themselves of that right..  On 6 August 2013 the Old Town Evangelical Church applied to the Bratislava I District Court for an eviction order against the occupants of this flat who had failed to vacate it by the expiry of the twelve‑month notice period. As the occupants eventually vacated the flat on 25 February 2015, the Old Town Evangelical Church withdrew its action and the proceedings in respect of it were discontinued on 9 March 2015. Until the vacation of the flat, the occupants had paid the Old Town Evangelical Church compensation in an amount equal to the regulated rent..  The tenants residing in flats nos. 1 and 9 on 22 Moyzesova St. in Žilina moved in 2002 into flats nos. 5 and 12 within the same building owing to rebuilding of the original flats. The tenants continued to pay the regulated rent.\n",
      "In 2003 flat no. 5 was rebuilt and its area was changed from 110.27 sq. m to 59.18 sq. m..  A similar situation arose in the residential building on 33 Pražská St. in Bratislava where in 2014 the tenant residing in flat no. 16 moved to flat no. 9, and in the residential building located on 15 Vrbovská cesta St. in Piešťany, where the tenant living in the flat no. 14 moved to flat no. 25.\n",

      "The applicant was born in [[Nigeria]] in 1975 and lives in Zölling.. In [[Nigeria]], the applicant completed eleven years of schooling and subsequently held various jobs in Lagos. After leaving the country, he lived in [[Spain]] from 1994 to 1997, living at first on social security and later working as a day-labourer on several farms. In 1997 he arrived in [[Germany]], where he applied for asylum under a different [[identity]]. His application was finally rejected in July 1998. He left [[Germany]] for Italy with a [[German]] national with whom he had started a relationship. In January 1999 he moved on to Spain, where he worked as a cook and waiter in various restaurants.. In October 2000 the applicant re-entered [[Germany]]. On 21 October 2000 his daughter, from his [[above-mentioned]] relationship, was born. The applicant’s daughter is a German national.. In 2000 and 2001 the applicant and the child’s mother lived together. From the outset they had, and continue to have, joint custody. On 11 December 2000, the Authority of the City of Munich issued the applicant a residence permit based on [[family]] ties, valid until 1 December 2001.. On 18 July 2001 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having committed an offence under the [[Narcotics]] Act (Betäubungsmittelgesetz)..  On 28 May 2002 the Munich Regional Court sentenced him to eight years’ imprisonment for drug trafficking on a large scale. It observed that the applicant had recruited and instructed the child’s mother as a drugs runner for two separate consignments of cocaine from South America to Europe in summer 1998 and in late 1999/early [[2000]]. It considered, in favour of the applicant, that this was his first criminal conviction, that the first delivery had failed (the drugs did not actually enter the distribution system), and that the applicant had been detained on remand since July 2001. The Regional Court held against the applicant that he had used as drugs runners two young women who were adolescents at the time the offences were committed, and who [[ran]] the risk of a lengthy prison sentence in South America; that he had exploited the naivety of his daughter’s mother; that a large amount of cocaine was meant to be smuggled in the first case and that four kilograms of cocaine were smuggled into Europe in the second case; and that the entire undertaking had been handled very professionally. In addition, the Regional Court considered that a conviction for a third case of drug smuggling could not be envisaged for the [[sole]] reason that the [[precise]] amount of cocaine transported in a suitcase from Peru to Spain could not be determined..  The applicant submitted that his daughter and her mother had visited him in prison from 2001 to 2003 and that he had sought a court ruling on contact with his daughter, when the child’s mother discontinued the visits. On 4 July 2006, the applicant and the child’s mother agreed before the Munich Family Court that supervised meetings between him and his daughter would take place as soon as he was released from prison. As of 31 January 2008, the daughter visited the applicant regularly in prison – every four weeks for two hours at a time – in the company of a priest..  On 3 July 2009 the applicant was released, after having served his entire sentence. He was placed under supervision of conduct (Führungsaufsicht) until 3 July 2013..  After his release, the applicant was [[granted]] exceptional leave to remain (Duldung) under Section 60a of the [[Residence]] Act – according to the information available to the Court this was granted most recently in January 2017 and would last until July 2017. It meant that enforcement of the expulsion order was temporarily suspended, being impossible to execute as the applicant did not have a valid passport (see paragraphs 28, 29 and 36‑42 below). He began occupational re-training as a management assistant in marketing communication in April 2010, which he successfully completed in June 2012, but was not allowed to engage in gainful employment since his release..  The applicant has not lived with his daughter and her mother since his release. Since 2012 they have been living in different cities, with distances between their homes varying between thirty and seventy kilometres and the travelling time varying between forty minutes and one hour. [[The]] applicant [[sees]] his daughter on a regular basis and maintains close contact with her. [[It]] is not disputed between the parties that she spends every other weekend with him. According to a [[social]] worker’s statement, he has become an important contact person for her. Both the applicant’s daughter and her mother explicitly wish the applicant’s contact with his child to continue..  Since his release, the applicant was convicted of three offences by the Munich District Court, of fraud in 2011 and of theft in 2015 and 2016. He was sentenced to twenty, thirty and ninety day-fines, respectively. [[By]] being present on German [[territory]] without having a passport, he committed an ongoing offence under the Residence Act. Criminal proceedings in this connection were discontinued by the public prosecutor in November 2013 because the applicant’s [[guilt]] was considered to be of a [[minor]] nature and because prosecution was not in the public interest. The matter was referred to the administrative authority for treatment as an administrative offence..  On 21 March 2003 the Authority of the City of Munich refused to renew the applicant’s residence permit and ordered his expulsion. It held that the applicant’s expulsion was mandatory pursuant to Section 47 § 1 of the Aliens Act (Ausländergesetz; since 2004: Section 53 of the Residence Act) which foresaw the mandatory expulsion of an alien if he or she were sentenced to either at least three years’ imprisonment for a criminal offence, or to any period of imprisonment (not on probation) for an offence under the Narcotics Act. The authority examined whether the applicant enjoyed special protection against expulsion because he was the father of a German child. It found that the applicant had lived with his daughter only for a short time prior to his imprisonment, she had thus experienced separation from the applicant and that, in the light of the applicant’s very serious criminal offences, the State’s interest in removing the applicant prevailed over his interest in enjoying family [[life]] with his daughter. He could remain in contact with her by letter or telephone and could apply for permission to enter [[Germany]] for specific periods of time (Betretenserlaubnis). It considered that the applicant’s expulsion was in conformity with Article 8 § 2 of the Convention. This decision, which also contained an unlimited re-entry ban and notice that he would be deported to Nigeria if he did not leave [[Germany]] voluntarily within four weeks after being released from prison, [[became]] final on 26 August 2003..  On 15 November 2006, after the applicant had served more than two thirds of his prison sentence, the authorities envisaged his expulsion as of 1 November 2007..  On 3 December 2007 the applicant introduced another asylum [[application]] (see paragraph 6 above). On 8 February [[2008]], the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees dismissed his application as manifestly ill‑founded under Section 30 § 3 of the Asylum [[Procedure]] Act (see paragraph 33 below) and, finding that there were no impediments to his return to his country of origin, ordered his expulsion. The decision again contained notice that he would be deported to Nigeria if he did not leave [[Germany]] voluntarily within one week after the decision [[became]] final. On 6 March [[2008]], the Munich Administrative Court granted suspensive effect to the applicant’s appeal in the asylum procedure. On 8 September 2009 it dismissed his appeal in the main procedure, also finding, inter alia, that the applicant’s ties to his daughter could not be taken into account in the asylum procedure. This decision [[became]] final on 1 December 2009..  On 10 September 2009 the applicant applied for a residence permit based on family ties..  On 9 February 2010 the Authority of the City of Munich rejected his application, holding that there was a final expulsion decision (of 21 March 2003) against the applicant, which precluded granting him a residence permit. No impediments arose from the fact that his daughter was a German national. The applicant could maintain contact with her through [[letters]], telephone calls and [[occasional]] visits. His daughter was accustomed to a long-distance relationship with him. He was responsible for the [[renewed]] separation and the purpose of the expulsion order had not [[yet]] been achieved. At the same time, it reduced the re-entry ban to five years and ruled that the applicant could, starting one year after his actual expulsion, apply for permission to enter [[Germany]] twice a year for a total of four weeks..  On 14 April [[2010]] the Munich Administrative Court [[quashed]] that decision and ordered the administrative authority to issue a residence permit. It noted that the applicant met the requirements for a residence permit based on family ties, but that granting such a permit was precluded by the final expulsion [[decision]]. However, the applicant was entitled to a residence permit on humanitarian grounds in accordance with Section 25 § 5 of the Residence Act, with the margin of appreciation inherent in this provision being reduced to zero. Section 11 § 1 of the Residence Act was not applicable to this provision and the applicant’s departure was impossible in law [[due]] to his family life with his daughter, which was protected, inter alia, by Article 8 of the Convention..  The Administrative Court found that, despite the [[serious]] nature of the criminal offences the applicant had committed, there was no public interest that outweighed the child’s best interests and the applicant’s interest in having [[contact]] with his daughter. [[The]] relationship between the applicant and his daughter had the quality of a “family” and their ties were of benefit to the child. It considered that they could only live together in [[Germany]], as the child could not be expected to [[relocate]] to Nigeria; that the applicant had committed the [[criminal]] offences prior to the birth of his daughter; that he had made considerable efforts as a father, as was also evidenced by his [[choice]] to remain imprisoned in [[Germany]] and to have supervised meetings with his daughter as of January 2008 rather than having his sentence suspended and being [[expelled]] as of 1 November 2007; that the latter event marked a turning point, which occurred after the expulsion order had [[become]] final in 2003 and which had not been taken into account by the administrative authorities; that the child had [[already]] been deprived of a relationship with her father for [[many]] years during his imprisonment; that the material assessment with a view to the applicant’s expulsion had been conducted on 21 March 2003, years before the developments in the father‑daughter relationship and the moment the expulsion order would be enforced; and that the enforcement of the expulsion order in connection with a re-entry ban would deprive the child of the possibility of a normal father-daughter relationship for the remainder of her childhood..  On 27 June 2011 the Bavarian Administrative Court of Appeal overturned that judgment and denied the applicant’s right to a residence permit. It considered that his asylum application had been rejected as manifestly ill-founded under Section 30 § 3 of the Asylum Procedure Act and that, therefore, in accordance with Section 10 § 3, second sentence, of the Residence Act, he could not be granted a residence permit [[prior]] to leaving [[Germany]] (see paragraph 33 below). The exception to this rule, foreseen in the third sentence of this paragraph, was not applicable because the applicant did not have a claim to a residence permit within the meaning of that provision (see paragraph 34 below)..  First, a claim to a residence permit based on family ties under [[Sections]] 27 et seq. of the Residence Act was precluded by Section 11 of the Residence Act due to the final expulsion order of 21 March 2003 (see paragraph 35 below). Second, a claim to a residence permit on humanitarian grounds under Section 25 § 5 of the Residence Act was proscribed because the applicant did not have a valid passport, which was a general requirement for the granting of a residence permit (see paragraph 32 below). As the decision to waive this requirement in cases concerning residence permits on humanitarian grounds was a discretionary one, the applicant did not have a claim to a residence permit within the meaning of Section 10 § 3, third [[sentence]], of the Residence Act, not even if the margin of appreciation were reduced to zero (see paragraph 34 below). Third, the court found that the applicant could not base a claim to a residence permit on impediments to his return to his country of origin either, referring to the outcome of the asylum proceedings in [[2008]] and 2009 (see paragraph 18 above). The Court of Appeal concluded that, under these circumstances, it was not [[decisive]] whether the ties between the applicant and his daughter were such that the requirements for a residence permit on humanitarian grounds under Section 25 § 5 of the Residence Act were met, if the applicant’s asylum application had not been dismissed, and refrained from elaborating on this [[aspect]]..  On 12 September 2011 the applicant lodged an action to be granted leave to appeal on points of law, arguing that his case raised a matter of [[fundamental]] importance. He submitted that he should be granted a residence permit under Section 25 § 5 of the Residence Act because, as the father of a minor child of German nationality for whom he had joint custody, he did, in principle, have a claim to a residence permit based on family ties. The [[purpose]] of Section 10 § 3 of the Residence Act was to sanction abuse of the asylum procedure, but an abusive asylum application should not bear [[negative]] consequences where the foreigner had a claim, within the meaning of that provision, to a residence permit. [[In]] that regard, it should be [[decisive]] whether or not the [[substantive]] requirements of the respective provision for a residence permit were met, as in his case with regard to the permit based on family [[ties]], and that the reason for the claim not being realised, in his case the final expulsion order against him, should not be relevant..  On 16 [[February]] 2012 the Federal Administrative Court rejected the applicant’s action. It noted that, according to the case-law of the domestic courts, the exception foreseen in Section 10 § 3, third sentence, of the Residence Act only applied to claims that followed directly from [[legislative]] provisions and in [[respect]] of which all requirements, general and specific, were met. A residence permit based on family ties was precluded because of the final expulsion [[order]] against the applicant. Under these circumstances, granting a residence permit on humanitarian grounds was to be considered. However, as the applicant did not have a valid passport, which was a general requirement for the granting of a residence permit from which derogations were, in [[cases]] concerning Section 25 § 5 of the Residence [[Act]], possible only by way of a discretionary decision, the exception foreseen in Section 10 § 3, third sentence, of the Residence Act was not applicable. The decision was served on the applicant on 22 February 2012..  On 22 March 2012 the applicant lodged a [[constitutional]] complaint with the Federal Constitutional Court, alleging that the decisions of the Administrative Court of Appeal and of the Federal Administrative Court violated his right to [[respect]] for his family life with his daughter. On 18 [[July]] 2012 the Federal Constitutional Court declined to accept the applicant’s constitutional complaint without providing reasons (no. 2 BvR 657/12)..  After the Authority of the City of [[Munich]], on 12 June 2012, had ordered the applicant to present himself to the Embassy of Nigeria in [[Germany]] so that a passport for the upcoming expulsion [[could]] be issued, the applicant refused to do so and filed an action against this [[order]] with the Munich Administrative Court. During the court hearing on 1 August [[2012]], the applicant and the immigration authorities agreed to the following:\n",
      "“- The effect of the re-entry ban will be limited to two and a half years after leaving [[Germany]].\n",
      "- The immigration authorities will give their consent for a visa to enter [[Germany]] based on family reunion. If the applicant by then still has joint custody with the child’s mother, a residence permit on the grounds of family ties will be issued. If the applicant no longer has joint custody for his daughter, the immigration authority will use its [[discretion]] regarding the issue of a residence permit in favour of the applicant.\n",
      "- All of this applies only if the applicant can show that he has not committed further criminal offences and if no other reasons for his expulsion emerge.\n",
      "- A [[time]]‑limit for leaving the country is set at 1 November 2012.”\n",
      "In the light of this agreement, the applicant withdrew his action, and the proceedings before the Munich Administrative Court were discontinued..  On 25 September 2012 the Embassy of Nigeria in [[Germany]] declared that it would not issue a passport to the applicant as long as the proceedings before this Court were pending. On 6 November 2012 the applicant informed the immigration authorities that he would not leave [[Germany]], contrary to his initial plans and to his declaration before the Munich Administrative Court. As a result, the agreement concluded before that court became void.\n",

      "The applicant was born in [[Niger]] in 1975 and lives in Zölling.. In [[Niger]], the applicant completed eleven years of schooling and subsequently held various jobs in Lagos. After leaving the country, he lived in [[S]] [[pain]] from 1994 to 1997, living at first on social security and later working as a day-labourer on several farms. In 1997 he arrived in [[Deutsche]], where he applied for asylum under a different [[identification]]. His application was finally rejected in July 1998. He left [[Deutsche]] for Italy with a [[G]] [[erman]] national with whom he had started a relationship. In January 1999 he moved on to Spain, where he worked as a cook and waiter in various restaurants.. In October 2000 the applicant re-entered [[Deutsche]]. On 21 October 2000 his daughter, from his [[above˗mentioned]] relationship, was born. The applicant’s daughter is a German national.. In 2000 and 2001 the applicant and the child’s mother lived together. From the outset they had, and continue to have, joint custody. On 11 December 2000, the Authority of the City of Munich issued the applicant a residence permit based on [[relatives]] ties, valid until 1 December 2001.. On 18 July 2001 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having committed an offence under the [[Drug]] Act (Betäubungsmittelgesetz)..  On 28 May 2002 the Munich Regional Court sentenced him to eight years’ imprisonment for drug trafficking on a large scale. It observed that the applicant had recruited and instructed the child’s mother as a drugs runner for two separate consignments of cocaine from South America to Europe in summer 1998 and in late 1999/early [[2]] [[000]]. It considered, in favour of the applicant, that this was his first criminal conviction, that the first delivery had failed (the drugs did not actually enter the distribution system), and that the applicant had been detained on remand since July 2001. The Regional Court held against the applicant that he had used as drugs runners two young women who were adolescents at the time the offences were committed, and who [[fled]] the risk of a lengthy prison sentence in South America; that he had exploited the naivety of his daughter’s mother; that a large amount of cocaine was meant to be smuggled in the first case and that four kilograms of cocaine were smuggled into Europe in the second case; and that the entire undertaking had been handled very professionally. In addition, the Regional Court considered that a conviction for a third case of drug smuggling could not be envisaged for the [[single]] reason that the [[concrete]] amount of cocaine transported in a suitcase from Peru to Spain could not be determined..  The applicant submitted that his daughter and her mother had visited him in prison from 2001 to 2003 and that he had sought a court ruling on contact with his daughter, when the child’s mother discontinued the visits. On 4 July 2006, the applicant and the child’s mother agreed before the Munich Family Court that supervised meetings between him and his daughter would take place as soon as he was released from prison. As of 31 January 2008, the daughter visited the applicant regularly in prison – every four weeks for two hours at a time – in the company of a priest..  On 3 July 2009 the applicant was released, after having served his entire sentence. He was placed under supervision of conduct (Führungsaufsicht) until 3 July 2013..  After his release, the applicant was [[awarded]] exceptional leave to remain (Duldung) under Section 60a of the [[R]] [[esidence]] Act – according to the information available to the Court this was granted most recently in January 2017 and would last until July 2017. It meant that enforcement of the expulsion order was temporarily suspended, being impossible to execute as the applicant did not have a valid passport (see paragraphs 28, 29 and 36‑42 below). He began occupational re-training as a management assistant in marketing communication in April 2010, which he successfully completed in June 2012, but was not allowed to engage in gainful employment since his release..  The applicant has not lived with his daughter and her mother since his release. Since 2012 they have been living in different cities, with distances between their homes varying between thirty and seventy kilometres and the travelling time varying between forty minutes and one hour. [[Te]] applicant [[expects]] his daughter on a regular basis and maintains close contact with her. [[He]] is not disputed between the parties that she spends every other weekend with him. According to a [[societies]] worker’s statement, he has become an important contact person for her. Both the applicant’s daughter and her mother explicitly wish the applicant’s contact with his child to continue..  Since his release, the applicant was convicted of three offences by the Munich District Court, of fraud in 2011 and of theft in 2015 and 2016. He was sentenced to twenty, thirty and ninety day-fines, respectively. [[Per]] being present on German [[lands]] without having a passport, he committed an ongoing offence under the Residence Act. Criminal proceedings in this connection were discontinued by the public prosecutor in November 2013 because the applicant’s [[g]] [[uilt]] was considered to be of a [[lesser]] nature and because prosecution was not in the public interest. The matter was referred to the administrative authority for treatment as an administrative offence..

His daughter was accustomed to a long-distance relationship with him. He was responsible for the [[renovated]] separation and the purpose of the expulsion order had not [[still]] been achieved. At the same time, it reduced the re-entry ban to five years and ruled that the applicant could, starting one year after his actual expulsion, apply for permission to enter [[Deutsche]] twice a year for a total of four weeks..

      "The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Ljubljana.. On 8 October 1992 the applicant became a member of L.E., which was at that time a public limited company operating under Slovenian law. The share capital of L.E. stood at 2,995,250 Slovenian tolars (SIT)[1] and the applicant’s capital contribution was SIT 332,805.55[2] (that is, 11.11% of the company’s share capital). L.E. had nine members in total.. On 2 February 1993 the applicant was employed by company L.E. as head of its IT department. In addition, he provided assistance to the finance director (bookkeeping)..  On 19 February 1993 two key members and directors of company L.E., Mr J. Za. and Mr M. D., died in a car accident. The first one, however, remained registered as a member of L.E. The shares of the second were taken over by Ms D. D. Two other members, Mr J. Zu. and Mr D. P., were seriously injured, but also remained registered as members of L.E. Following those events, the applicant assumed the role of acting director of L.E. on 29 April 1993, and then of managing director on 23 February 1995. In that capacity he acted as the company’s representative..  In 1993 the Slovenian Railways, a statutory company, initiated civil proceedings against L.E., claiming the payment of three sums arising from their business dealings, totalling approximately SIT 5,000,000. The applicant represented L.E. at all hearings held in that case except for the last hearing on 22 November 2000..  On 9 August 1995 Mr M. K., another member of L.E., died, but nevertheless remained registered as a member..  In November 1995 L.E. was aligned with the Companies Act 1993, as required (see paragraph 35 below), and at the same time converted from a public limited company into a limited liability company (see paragraph 33 below). At that time L.E. was already both illiquid and insolvent..  On 6 May 1996 the general meeting of L.E. dismissed the applicant from the post of managing director. Since the members failed to appoint a new director, as required (see paragraph 37 below), the applicant’s dismissal was not entered in the court register and he remained registered as managing director of L.E..  On 19 June 1997, on the applicant’s initiative, the general meeting of L.E. decided to start winding-up proceedings. The applicant made a winding-up petition on behalf of L.E. on 23 June 1997, declaring that the company had been insolvent for some time and that its total debt was SIT 22,393,952. On 16 July 1997 the competent court ordered L.E. to make, within 15 days, the required advance payment to cover the costs of the publication of the winding-up order in the Official Gazette in the amount of SIT 150,000[3]. The applicant alleged that some members of L.E. had refused to contribute to the advance payment and had preferred to wait for the competent court to wind up the company of its own motion, in accordance with the then applicable legislation (see paragraph 40 below)..  On 31 July 1997 the applicant stopped working for L.E..  On 25 September 1997 another member of L.E., Mr J. Zu., died, but nevertheless remained registered as a member..  On 15 October 1997 L.E.’s winding-up petition was rejected for failure to make the required advance payment..  By a judgment of 22 November 2000, the District Court of Ljubljana ordered L.E. to pay the Slovenian Railways the sums claimed plus interest (see paragraph 11 above). L.E. did not appeal; the judgment became final on 12 January 2001..  On the basis of notification from the competent authority that L.E. had not performed any transactions through its bank account in a period of twelve consecutive months, on 19 January 2001 the Ljubljana District Court – acting in its capacity as the registry court – initiated proceedings to strike off the company from the court register pursuant to the Financial Operations of Companies Act 1999 (hereinafter “the FOCA”; paragraphs 41-52 below)..  On the same day, the decision to initiate strike-off proceedings was entered in the court register. The decision was sent to the registered address of L.E., but since no representative of the company was there to receive it, a delivery slip was left in its mailbox, notifying the company that the relevant correspondence could be collected at the post office. On 12 February 2001 the decision was returned to the registry court with the information that the addressee had failed to collect it. The registry court then served it by posting it on its notice board, as provided for by domestic law..  No objection was made to the decision of 19 January 2001, either by L.E. or by its members. Consequently, on 11 May 2001 the registry court issued a decision to strike off L.E. from the court register. The decision was published in the Official Gazette on 30 May 2001[4]. The registry court also attempted to serve the decision on L.E. by sending it to the company’s address, but like the previous decision, it was returned on 4 June 2001 with the information that the addressee had failed to collect it. The decision was again posted on the registry court’s notice board. Neither company L.E. nor any of its members, who were entitled to lodge an appeal against the strike-off decision, appealed against the decision, so on 17 August 2001 it became final..  On 25 September 2001 L.E. was struck off from the court register and thus ceased to exist. Notification of the strike-off was published in the Official Gazette on 6 February 2002[5]. At the time of the strike-off, L.E. had nine registered members (including the applicant). The applicant stated that he had become aware that his company had been struck off on 22 December 2004, when a writ was served on him (see paragraph 24 below)..  On 5 April 2002 the above-mentioned creditor applied to the Ljubljana Local Court for the judgment mentioned in paragraph 19 above to be enforced. On 5 June 2002 the court issued a writ of execution, ordering the seizure and sale of all tangible movable property of the applicant and six other members of L.E. It later revoked the writ in respect of Mr J. Za., Mr M. K. and Mr J. Zu., as they had died (see paragraphs 10, 12 and 17 above). At the request of the creditor, on 30 November 2004 the court expanded the writ, ordering the payment of the judgment debt by direct deduction from the earnings of the applicant and of three other members of L.E. The writ was served on the applicant on 22 December 2004..  On 29 December 2004 the applicant lodged an objection to the writ, arguing that the Local Court had failed to establish his actual role in company L.E. or to acknowledge his status as a passive member (see paragraph 51 below), which would have exonerated him from liability for the debts of the company. He maintained that the creditor’s claim against the company had arisen before he had joined it. Moreover, the applicant was of the view that the onus was on the creditor to establish that he had been an active member of the company. Lastly, he applied for a stay of enforcement..  In its judgment of 12 March 2005, the Ljubljana Local Court found that the onus of proving his status as passive member was on the applicant and that he had failed to prove that he had not been an active member of L.E. The court established that with his 11.11% share in the company, the applicant had enjoyed the rights of a minority member, and furthermore, he had been employed by the company and actively involved in its management since April 1993. In his capacity as acting director and later managing director, he had been authorised to act on behalf of the company. Moreover, even after he had resigned as managing director, he had still been active in the running of the company and had also signed the winding-up petition. Lastly, the court considered that, as a minority member, the applicant could have and should have proposed the appointment of a new director at a general meeting of the company, since pursuant to domestic law all companies had to have a director. For those reasons, the applicant’s objection was rejected. The court also dismissed the applicant’s request for a stay of enforcement, as he had failed to demonstrate that the enforcement would have caused him irreparable or serious damage..  On 9 February 2006 the Ljubljana Higher Court rejected an appeal lodged by the applicant on essentially the same grounds as the first-instance court. It observed, inter alia, that the Constitutional Court had found the measure of lifting the corporate veil under the FOCA to be in line with the principle of the separation of a company’s assets from those of its members and thus consistent with the Constitution. The court considered it irrelevant whether the applicant had become a member of L.E. before or after the creditor’s claim had arisen. Having joined the company, he had assumed its assets as well as its liabilities. It further held that it was not decisive that the applicant had not remained a director of L.E. until the dissolution of that company. What was crucial was that the applicant had been actively involved in its management and that he had had the rights of a minority member pursuant to section 445 of the Companies Act 1993 (see paragraph 37 below). The court noted that, in contrast to section 6 of the Companies Act 1993 which required the creditors of a company to prove that a member of the company had abused the corporate form (see paragraph 34 below), the FOCA had introduced a “non-rebuttable” presumption that the members of a struck-off company were deemed to have undertaken joint and several liability for any outstanding debts of the company. In accordance with the Constitutional Court’s ruling, they could be exonerated from their personal liability only if they demonstrated that they were “passive members” of the company (see paragraphs 46 and 51 below). Lastly, the court took note of the fact that the applicant had indeed made a winding-up petition on behalf of L.E., but it considered this irrelevant because L.E. had at the time failed to make the required advance payment and the petition had therefore been rejected (see paragraphs 15 and 18 above)..  On 5 May 2006 the applicant lodged two constitutional complaints. In one of them, he complained that the decisions rendered in the strike-off proceedings against L.E. had been served on that company alone and not on him personally. In the other one, he complained about the outcome of the enforcement proceedings against him..  On 31 January 2007 the Constitutional Court rejected the applicant’s complaint regarding the strike-off proceedings. The decision was served on the applicant on 5 February 2007. It found that the applicant lacked legal interest in challenging those proceedings, since L.E. had already been struck off from the court register. Consequently, even a positive outcome of the constitutional complaint could not improve the applicant’s position..  On 9 July 2007 the Constitutional Court also rejected the complaint regarding the enforcement proceedings as manifestly ill-founded. It held that the lower courts had correctly applied the Constitutional Court’s criteria for differentiating between active and passive members to the applicant’s individual situation..  In 2010 the judgment of 22 November 2000 was enforced in part by direct deduction from the applicant’s salary. On 23 September 2011 the applicant reached an out-of-court settlement with the creditor and paid the agreed amount. The enforcement proceedings against the applicant were terminated on 28 September 2011. In total, the applicant paid EUR 32,795 to the Slovenian Railways. It is not clear how much other members of L.E. have paid to the Slovenian Railways in this connection.\n",

      "The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Louvencourt.. He was hired in 1976 by the French national railway company (Société nationale des chemins de fer – “the SNCF”), where he last worked as Deputy Head of the Amiens Regional Surveillance Unit. He stated that in 2007 he had complained to senior management about the conduct of one of his subordinates, who, he alleged, had used extreme language when addressing a colleague. The employee in question had then filed a complaint against him, following which the applicant had been charged with making false accusations. The applicant had subsequently been suspended from duty by the SNCF on grounds of that charge.. The proceedings were discontinued a few months later, whereupon the applicant notified his employers of his wish to be reinstated in his former post. He received a reply inviting him to consider appointment to another post, but maintained his original request.. On the day of his reinstatement, on 17 March 2008, the applicant found that his work computer had been seized. After being summoned by his superiors, he was informed on 5 April 2008 that the hard disk on the computer had been analysed and that “address change certificates drawn up for third persons and bearing the Lille General Security Service logo” had been found, as well as a large number of files containing pornographic images and films. It can be seen from the judgment of the Amiens Court of Appeal of 15 December 2010 (see paragraphs 14-15 below) that the person who had replaced the applicant during his suspension from post had found “documents which had caught his attention” on the computer, and that he had alerted his superiors in March 2007 and January 2008..  A request for a written explanation was sent to the applicant on 7 May 2008. He replied that in 2006, following problems with his personal computer, he had transferred the contents of one of his USB keys to his work computer. He added that the files containing pornographic material had been sent to him by people he did not know, via the SNCF’s Intranet..  The applicant was summoned to a disciplinary hearing, which took place on 21 May 2008. On 9 June 2008 he was informed by the “resources management director” of Amiens head office that a proposal had been made to dismiss him from the service and that he would be summoned to appear before the disciplinary board. The board convened on 15 July 2008..  On 17 July 2008 the SNCF regional director decided to dismiss the applicant from the service. His decision was worded as follows:\n",
      "“ ... the analysis of the files stored on the hard disk of [the applicant’s] work computer, used for his professional duties, contained the following:\n",
      "i) change of address certificate, signed in his name, certifying the transfer on 01/11/2003 of Ms Catherine [T.] to the Lille General Security Service; the original certificate, sent to ICF North-East enabled the notice period for vacating her flat to be shortened;\n",
      "ii) change of address certificate, bearing the Ministry of Justice logo, in the name of M. [S.-J.], governor of Fresnes Prison, certifying the transfer of M. [P.] Frédéric to Strasbourg Prison, from 1 November 2006;\n",
      "iii) draft documents drawn up in the name of Michel [V.], director of the SOCRIF, certifying his financial situation with regard to that company;\n",
      "iv) a very large number of files containing pornographic images and films (zoophilia and scatophilia).\n",
      "These facts are in breach of the special obligation of exemplary conduct inherent in the duties formerly performed by him within the General Security Service, and of the following provisions:\n",
      "i) Article 5.2 of the RH 0006 on the principles governing the conduct of SNCF officials;\n",
      "ii) the general security database RG 0029 (information systems security policy – user’s charter);\n",
      "iii) the RA 0024 “code of professional conduct” - conduct to be observed with regard to the company’s information system;\n",
      "iv) Article 441-1 of the Criminal Code.”.  On 28 October 2008 the applicant brought proceedings before the Amiens Industrial Tribunal (conseil des prud’hommes) seeking a ruling that he had been dismissed without genuine or serious cause. On 10 May 2010 the Industrial Tribunal held that the decision dismissing the applicant from the service had been justified and, accordingly, rejected his claims.. On 15 December 2010 the Amiens Court of Appeal upheld the substance of that judgment. It held, in particular, as follows:\n",
      "“ ... [The applicant] submitted that the SNCF had infringed his private life by opening, in his absence, files identified as personal in his computer.\n",
      "As a matter of policy, documents kept by employees in the company’s office, save those identified by them as personal, are presumed to be for professional use, meaning that the employer can have access to them in the employee’s absence.\n",
      "It can be seen from the report drawn up by the SEF that the pornographic photos and videos were found in a file called “fun” stored on a hard disk labelled “D:/personal data”.\n",
      "The SNCF explained, without being challenged, that the “D” drive was called “D:/data” by default and was traditionally used by staff to store their work documents.\n",
      "An employee cannot use an entire hard disk, which is supposed to record professional data, for his or her private use. The SNCF were therefore entitled to consider that the description “personal data” appearing on the hard disk could not validly prohibit their access to it. In any event, the generic term “personal data” could have referred to work files being personally processed by the employee and did not therefore explicitly designate elements relating to his private life. That had been the case here, moreover, since the analysis of the hard disk yielded numerous work documents (“LGV photos” file, “warehouse photos” ... .\n",
      "The term “fun”, moreover, does not clearly convey that the file in question is necessarily private. The term can denote exchanges between colleagues at work or work documents kept as “bloopers” by the employee. The employer also rightly pointed out that the user’s charter provided that “private information [had to] be clearly identified as such (“private” option in the Outlook criteria)” and that the same was true of the media receiving that information (“private” folder). The lower court was therefore correct in considering that the file had not been identified as personal.\n",
      "The same applies to the files containing the impugned certificates registered under the names “Fred [P.]”, “SOCRIF” and “Catherine”.”.  The Court of Appeal also held that the applicant’s dismissal from the service had not been disproportionate. It observed that both the SNCF’s Code of Professional Conduct and the internal rules provided that staff were required to use the computers provided to them for exclusively professional ends, with the occasional private use being merely tolerated. It found that the applicant had committed a “massive breach of those rules, going as far as using his work tools to produce a forged document”. In the court’s view, those acts had been particularly serious because, as an official responsible for general surveillance, he would have been expected to be of exemplary conduct..  The applicant appealed on points of law. He submitted, in particular, that there had been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention. The Social Division of the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal in a judgment of 4 July 2012. It held as follows:\n",
      "“ ... whilst files created by an employee with the assistance of the computer facilities supplied to him by his employer for work purposes are presumed to be professional in nature, meaning that the employer is entitled to open them in the employee’s absence, unless they are identified as personal, the description given to the hard disk itself cannot confer privacy on all the data contained in it. The Court of Appeal, which found that labelling the hard disk in the employee’s computer “D:/ personal data” could not enable him to use it for purely private purposes and prohibit access by the employer, drew the legitimate conclusion that the files in question, which had not been identified as “private” according to the recommendations of the IT charter, could be lawfully opened by the employer.\n",
      "The Court of Appeal, which found that the employee had stored 1,562 pornographic files representing a volume of 787 megabytes over a period of four years, and that he had also used his work computer to produce forged certificates, rightly held that such misuse of his office equipment in breach of the rules in force at the SNCF amounted to a breach of his contractual obligations. ...”.\n",

      "The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Ljubljana.. On 8 October 1992 the applicant became a member of L.E., which was at that time a public limited company operating under Slovenian law. The share capital of L.E. stood at 2,995,250 Slovenian tolars (SIT)[1] and the applicant’s capital contribution was SIT 332,805.55[2] (that is, 11.11% of the company’s share capital). L.E. had nine members in total.. On 2 February 1993 the applicant was employed by company L.E. as head of its IT department. In addition, he provided assistance to the finance director (bookkeeping)..  On 19 February 1993 two key members and directors of company L.E., Mr J. Za. and Mr M. D., died in a car accident. The first one, however, remained registered as a member of L.E. The shares of the second were taken over by Ms D. D. Two other members, Mr J. Zu. and Mr D. P., were seriously injured, but also remained registered as members of L.E. Following those events, the applicant assumed the role of acting director of L.E. on 29 April 1993, and then of managing director on 23 February 1995. In that capacity he acted as the company’s representative..  In 1993 the Slovenian Railways, a statutory company, initiated civil proceedings against L.E., claiming the payment of three sums arising from their business dealings, totalling approximately SIT 5,000,000. The applicant represented L.E. at all hearings held in that case except for the last hearing on 22 November 2000..  On 9 August 1995 Mr M. K., another member of L.E., died, but nevertheless remained registered as a member..  In November 1995 L.E. was aligned with the Companies Act 1993, as required (see paragraph 35 below), and at the same time converted from a public limited company into a limited liability company (see paragraph 33 below). At that time L.E. was already both illiquid and insolvent..  On 6 May 1996 the general meeting of L.E. dismissed the applicant from the post of managing director. Since the members failed to appoint a new director, as required (see paragraph 37 below), the applicant’s dismissal was not entered in the court register and he remained registered as managing director of L.E..  On 19 June 1997, on the applicant’s initiative, the general meeting of L.E. decided to start winding-up proceedings. The applicant made a winding-up petition on behalf of L.E. on 23 June 1997, declaring that the company had been insolvent for some time and that its total debt was SIT 22,393,952. On 16 July 1997 the competent court ordered L.E. to make, within 15 days, the required advance payment to cover the costs of the publication of the winding-up order in the Official Gazette in the amount of SIT 150,000[3]. The applicant alleged that some members of L.E. had refused to contribute to the advance payment and had preferred to wait for the competent court to wind up the company of its own motion, in accordance with the then applicable legislation (see paragraph 40 below)..  On 31 July 1997 the applicant stopped working for L.E..  On 25 September 1997 another member of L.E., Mr J. Zu., died, but nevertheless remained registered as a member..  On 15 October 1997 L.E.’s winding-up petition was rejected for failure to make the required advance payment..  By a judgment of 22 November 2000, the District Court of Ljubljana ordered L.E. to pay the Slovenian Railways the sums claimed plus interest (see paragraph 11 above). L.E. did not appeal; the judgment became final on 12 January 2001..

The registry court then served it by posting it on its notice board, as provided for by domestic law..  No objection was made to the decision of 19 January 2001, either by L.E. or by its members. Consequently, on 11 May 2001 the registry court issued a decision to strike off L.E. from the court register. The decision was published in the Official Gazette on 30 May 2001[4]. The registry court also attempted to serve the decision on L.E. by sending it to the company’s address, but like the previous decision, it was returned on 4 June 2001 with the information that the addressee had failed to collect it. The decision was again posted on the registry court’s notice board. Neither company L.E. nor any of its members, who were entitled to lodge an appeal against the strike-off decision, appealed against the decision, so on 17 August 2001 it became final..  On 25 September 2001 L.E. was struck off from the court register and thus ceased to exist. Notification of the strike-off was published in the Official Gazette on 6 February 2002[5].

      "The case concerned the publication of a newspaper article on the website of The New York Times. In the article the applicant had been mentioned by name and, based on reports by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (hereinafter “the FBI”) and European law-enforcement agencies, the applicant’s alleged ties to Russian organised crime had been publicised. The applicant’s attempt to obtain an injunction order before the domestic courts had been unsuccessful.. The applicant was born in 1947 and lives in Düsseldorf. He is an internationally active entrepreneur in the media sector and chief executive officer of the media company Innova Film GmbH.. He also holds the position of Vice-President of the World Jewish Congress and President of the Jewish Confederation of Ukraine. In 2010 the former mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, publicly honoured the applicant for his efforts to improve American‑Russian relations.. On 12 June 2001, the daily newspaper The New York Times published an article about an investigation into corruption against R.L. A slightly changed version was also published on the newspaper’s website. The online version, which was the subject of the domestic proceedings (see paragraphs 12-20 below), reads, in so far as relevant, as follows (emphasis added and names abbreviated by the Court):\n",
      "“[L] Media Company Faces a Federal Inquiry\n",
      "By [R. B.]\n",
      "Published: June 12 2001\n",
      "WASHINGTON, June 10— A company owned by [R.L.], the cosmetics heir and former New York City mayoral candidate, is under investigation by federal prosecutors over allegations that it paid at least $1 million in bribes to Ukrainian officials for a valuable television license, according to lawyers and Justice Department documents.\n",
      "The United States attorney in Manhattan, [M.W.], has empaneled a grand jury and issued subpoenas, and prosecutors are studying some 6,000 pages of documents from Central European Media enterprise, which [R.L.] founded in 1991 as part of a plan to build a media empire in Europe. It now owns television stations in several Central and Eastern European countries.\n",
      "In a Federal District Court filing in New York last year, [M.W.] sought the corporate documents, saying that they were needed for a criminal investigation into whether [R.L.]´s Central European Media had ‘made corrupt and unlawful payments to Ukrainian officials’ in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the federal law that prohibits American companies from paying bribes abroad. [R.L.] and the company did not challenge the request and turned over the documents, a lawyer said.\n",
      "The payments being examined took place in 1996 after Ukraine´s licencing body granted a potentially lucrative licence to [R.L.]´s company despite the fact that the Ukraine Parliament had imposed a ban on new licences.\n",
      "...\n",
      "In Ukraine, Central European Media controls the most popular station through its majority-owned subsidiary Studio 1 + 1.\n",
      "Prosecutors are studying two transactions related to Central European Media’s Ukraine investment, according to documents and persons close to the investigation. In one, prosecutors are trying to determine if L’s company paid $1.2 million to two Lebanese businessmen living in Ukraine, who then distributed it to some members of Ukraine’s television licensing board.\n",
      "... [R.L.]’s bid to gain the television license in Ukraine began in 1995. That year, he met in New York with [O.V.], a top adviser to Ukraine President [L.K.], to discuss business opportunities.\n",
      "The initial meetings between [R.L.] and his representatives and [O.V.] were not promising. ...\n",
      "[O.V.] suggested that [R.L.] team up with a new Ukrainian television broadcasting company, Studio 1 + 1, in Kiev, and he did. The principal owners were [V.R.] and Boris Fuchsmann, well known around Kiev for their influence and wealth. Less well known were their ties to Russian organized crime, according to reports by the F.B.I. and European law enforcement agencies.\n",
      "[V.R.], who no longer has an interest in 1 + 1, has denied any links to Russian organized crime. Mr. Fuchsmann did not respond to e-mail inquiries seeking comment on the licensing deal and the F.B.I.’s claim of his ties to organized crime, although an assistant confirmed that he had received the inquiries.\n",
      "A 1994 F.B.I. report on Russian organized crime in the United States described Mr. Fuchsmann as a gold smuggler and embezzler, whose company in Germany was part of an international organized crime network. He is barred from entering the United States.\n",
      "...\n",
      "Besides Mr. Fuchsmann and [V.R.], there were other, silent owners of Studio 1 + 1. In one internal fax, in April 1996, [J] described the Studio 1 + 1 shareholders as ‘‘extremely powerful’ people whom, she added, ‘I will not mention on this fax.’\n",
      "Central European Media now owns 60 percent of Studio 1 + 1, and Mr. Fuchsmann owns at least 30 percent, according to public statements.\n",
      "At the time it went into business with Mr. Fuchsmann and [V.R.], Central European Media did not conduct investigations into their backgrounds, according to a report by [R.L.]’s New York law firm, [D.&P.].\n",
      "In their 20-page report, which the prosecutors now have, the firm’s lawyers said that [R.L.] had been justified in dealing with Mr. Fuchsmann and [V.R.] because they had been highly recommended by [O.V.], whom the lawyers described as ‘an ardent supporter of free-market business’.\n",
      "The lawyers also concluded that Central European Media had not engaged in any illegal or improper activities. They said they could not rule out the possibility that Studio 1 + 1 had made improper payments, though they did not believe it had.\n",
      "The Ukraine’s television licensing board issued a broadcast license to Studio 1 + 1 not only in spite of Parliament’s moratorium, but with only four of the board’s eight members present; the law required at least six members for a vote.\n",
      "A few days after the license was issued, Central European Media transferred $1.4 million to International Teleservices of Belize, according to a C.M.E. Wire Transfer Request. That is the second transaction being looked at by prosecutors.\n",
      "The Belize company was indirectly owned by ‘many high Ukrainian officials,’ according to a second C.M.E. document, which did not name them.\n",
      "A third document shows that International Teleservices had paid this amount to a company in Germany owned by Mr. Fuchsmann, Innova, and that Innova had paid the license fees on behalf of Studio 1 + 1. Innova is part of a Russian organized crime network, according to U.S. and German law enforcement reports.\n",
      "It is not clear why such a circuitous route was used, and a person involved in the transaction, with inside knowledge of the owners of International Teleservices, said the $1.4 million payment was not for a license fee. He would not say what it was for.\n",
      "Central European Media officials were nervous about the license they won, and sought the opinion of two law firms in Kiev. Both acknowledged ‘the potential weaknesses’ of the broadcasting license, according to a C.M.E. document. One week later, O.V. had secured a letter from the Ukrainian justice ministry stating that the license was valid.\n",
      "Federal prosecutors, who opened their case in the wake of a number of private lawsuits challenging the legitimacy of the license award, have been examining documents for nearly a year, and the exact status of the investigation is not clear.”.  On 28 May 2001, before publication of the article, the journalist had notified the applicant, via an email to one of his employees, of the planned publication and had asked several questions. On 30 May 2001 the journalist had made a follow-up telephone call to the employee, who confirmed that the applicant had received the questions. However, the applicant refrained from answering the questions or commenting on the planned publication..  Since 12 June 2001 the article, showing the date of first publication, is retrievable from the website of The New York Times. It can also be found through online search engines such as “Google” or “Bing”..  On 31 July 2002 the applicant sought injunctions against certain parts of the article (highlighted in the article, see paragraph 9 above), published in the print and online versions..  On 9 January 2008 the Düsseldorf Regional Court declared the applicant’s action inadmissible due to lack of international jurisdiction on the part of the German courts. It found that, at the material time, the print version of The New York Times was not distributed in Germany and that the Internet version of the newspaper was not directed at a readership in Germany. The Düsseldorf Court of Appeal confirmed that decision by its judgment dated 30 December 2008. On 2 March 2010 the Federal Court of Justice quashed the part of the decision regarding the applicant’s claim for an injunction against the challenged statements in the online version of the article and referred that part of the action back to the Court of Appeal. The court held that the online version of the newspaper was accessible from Germany, and because it mentioned a German businessman in the article, the publication had a direct connection with Germany and German jurisdiction. It therefore affirmed the international jurisdiction of the German courts in that respect..  On 22 June 2011 the Court of Appeal decided on the part of the dispute which had been referred back to it by the Federal Court of Justice. It granted the injunction in so far as the article stated that the applicant had been banned from entering the United States, and dismissed the remainder of the applicant’s action for lack of merit. The Court of Appeal held that German law was applicable with regard to the online publication, as the article was accessible in Germany via the Internet and therefore the alleged violation of the applicant’s reputation had at least occurred in Germany..  The court accepted that the statements interfered with the applicant’s reputation and personality right (allgemeines Persönlichkeitsrecht) as protected by Article 2 § 1 and Article 1 § 1 of the Basic Law (Grundgesetz). However, as the statements had been made in the press, which was constitutionally protected pursuant to Article 5 § 1 of the Basic Law, it was necessary to balance both interests. Moreover, as the statements concerned a suspicion against the applicant, the presumption of innocence arising from Article 6 § 2 of the Convention and from German law also had to be taken into account. The court held that there was in principle a public interest in reporting on criminal offences, including the suspicion of their commission. On the other hand, continued the court, the interference with the rights of personality associated with such reporting required higher standards of care for newspaper reporting, because even if the investigation was later discontinued, “something of the accusation might stick to the person affected”. Therefore, concrete, provable connecting facts which go beyond a vague, intangible suspicion were required, the reporting must concern an incident of great weight and the suspicion must be identified as such. In addition, the reporting must be balanced, the journalist must not fail to report on exculpatory circumstances and the person concerned must, as a rule, be invited to make his own comments before publication..  As regards the statements at issue, the Court of Appeal held that there was a great informational interest on the part of the public in the reporting that the applicant, as a German businessman internationally active in the media sector, was suspected by the secret service of being involved in gold smuggling, embezzlement and organised crime. This assessment was not changed by the fact that the applicant had been mentioned by name in the article, or by the fact that when the article was published in 2001, the criminal offences mentioned therein had occurred more than sixteen years previously. Regarding the latter the court pointed out that the criminal offences had become relevant again, due to new suspicions regarding the involvement of a former mayoral candidate. For the understanding of these suspicions it had been necessary to elaborate on the companies and individuals, including the applicant, involved in the alleged corruption. Similarly, describing the suspected criminal backgrounds of some of the persons involved had been necessary for the readers’ comprehension of the allegation. The court also took into account that the article remained accessible in an online archive of the daily newspaper. It held that there was a recognised public interest not only in information on current events but also in being able to research events from recent history..  The court further considered that the reporting was free from polemic statements and insinuations, and made it sufficiently clear that only insights from FBI reports and the law-enforcement authorities were being reported. This was expressly pointed out in the challenged article with the words, \"according to reports by the F.B.I. and European law enforcement agencies\". The internal FBI report was confirmed by reports of several other law-enforcement agencies, and the applicant himself, while denying any criminal activities, confirmed certain facts mentioned in those reports during the proceedings. Furthermore, the author of the article had notified the applicant via email that the article would be published. In that context the court also considered that although the applicant had been aware of the defendant’s reporting even before the article had been published, he had waited for more than one year before applying for an injunction against the defendant. Therefore, the applicant had not perceived the interference with his personality right as intolerable..  In sum, the court concluded that the defendant had complied with the required journalistic duty of care and that the reporting had relied on sources and background information, which the journalist could reasonably consider reliable. Therefore, the informational interest of the public outweighed the concerns of protecting the applicant’s personality right, even taking into account that such reporting might seriously damage his private and professional reputation. Regarding the alleged entry ban, the court concluded that there had been no reliable sources and that the applicant had shown that he had recently travelled to the United States..  On 2 October 2012, the Federal Court of Justice rejected a complaint lodged by the applicant against the Court of Appeal’s refusal to grant leave to appeal on points of law..  On 26 April 2013 the Federal Constitutional Court declined to consider a constitutional complaint (no. 1 BvR 2387/12) lodged by the applicant, without providing reasons.\n",

      "The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Chişinău.. The applicant had a dispute with H. over ownership of a house. He brought a claim against H. seeking acknowledgement of his property rights, as his father’s heir, and H.’s eviction from the house. H. lodged a counterclaim, seeking acknowledgement of her property rights to the house as she had built it.. On 20 December 2007 the Buiucani District Court dismissed H.’s counterclaim and allowed the applicant’s claim in full. H. lodged an appeal. On 20 May 2008 the Chișinău Court of Appeal upheld the earlier judgment and dismissed H.’s appeal. H. did not attend the appellate hearing, even though the summons had been repeatedly sent to the address she had provided in her appeal. A registered letter was returned with a note stating that H. did not live at the address indicated by her. The judgment became final after the expiry of the two-month time-limit for lodging an appeal on points of law.. On 11 May 2009 H. lodged an appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court of Justice, stating that she had only learned of the judgment of 20 May 2008 on 23 April 2009. In her application, she indicated the same address as in the proceedings before the Court of Appeal. The applicant asked the Supreme Court of Justice to dismiss the appeal as being lodged outside the legal time-limit. He submitted that since it had been H. who had lodged the appeal with the Chişinău Court of Appeal, it had been her duty to enquire about the progress of the proceedings and not to wait for a year before doing so.. On 16 October 2009 the Supreme Court of Justice allowed H.’s appeal on points of law, quashed the previous judgments and delivered a new judgment on the merits of the case dividing the disputed house into equal shares between the applicant and H. The court argued that the appeal had not been lodged outside the time-limit because H. had not attended the hearing before the Court of Appeal and there was nothing in the file to suggest that that court had informed her of the availability of the full judgment. The court concluded that without any evidence of the date when H. had learned of the judgment, her appeal was considered to have been submitted on time. The judgment was final.\n",

      "The applicant was born in 1939 and lives in Sofia.. The applicant owns one half of a plot of land in the village of Golyamo Buchino, close to the city of Pernik. He also owned one half of a house standing on the plot, in which he lived until 1997, and one half of two smaller buildings, a barn and a pen. Those buildings no longer exist.. On an unspecified date towards the end of the 1980s or the beginning of the 1990s the State took a decision to create an opencast coalmine near the village. In a decision of 8 May 1990 the local mayor expropriated about ninety properties in the area for that purpose, including the applicant’s land and buildings.. The expropriation decision stated that the applicant should receive in compensation another plot of land in the village. The applicant received additionally a sum of money (the parties have not presented the decision of the mayor on the additional compensation). The majority of the remaining owners received either monetary compensation or flats in the city of Pernik. As another plot was not provided to the applicant within the statutory time‑limit of one year, on 21 August 1992 he requested that the expropriation be cancelled, as he was entitled to under section 102 of the Property Act (see paragraph 24 below). Another person who was due a plot of land in compensation also applied to have the expropriation of her property cancelled. In a decision of 2 October 1992 the Pernik regional governor cancelled the two expropriations, noting that the plots of land due in compensation had not been provided “owing to the impossibility for the municipality to ensure such plots”. The decision stated furthermore that the owners had to pay back the monetary compensation they had additionally received. On 22 December 1993 the applicant paid back that compensation.. The applicant remained in his house. In the years which followed the mine approached the house, due to its gradual enlargement. Coal was extracted from it by means of detonations, which, according to the applicant, shook the house on a daily basis. On unspecified dates cracks appeared on the walls of the house, and the barn and the pen collapsed. Towards the beginning of 1997 the applicant’s family moved out of the house, judging it too dangerous to stay..  Subsequently, the applicant contacted the mine, seeking to obtain compensation, but the negotiations failed. At the time, the mine was managed by a company which was wholly State-owned. In 2005 it was privatised..  In 2001 the applicant brought a tort action against the company operating the mine, seeking compensation for the damage caused to his property..  The Pernik Regional Court (“the Regional Court”), which examined the case at first instance, heard a witness, a neighbour of the applicant, who stated during a court hearing of 13 December 2001 that the walls of the applicant’s house were cracked, that its state continued to deteriorate, and that the barn had collapsed three or four years earlier. He thought that the house had been well constructed, and explained that after the initial damage the applicant had attempted to repair it. On 7 March 2002 the Regional Court heard another witness, who stated that most of the damage to the applicant’s house had been caused three or four years earlier..  The Regional Court appointed an expert, who established that the house had been constructed between 1948 and 1950, when there had been no requirements as to seismic resistance. At the time of drawing up the expert report the house was uninhabitable, as its walls were bent and cracked, with the cracks sometimes reaching 20-35 cm in width. The distance between the house and the mine’s periphery was about 160‑180 metres. This meant that the house was situated well inside the so‑called “sanitation zone” consisting of land within 500 metres of the mine’s edge, inside which the law prohibited any dwellings. The “security zone” for the mine, within which no unauthorised person was to be present during detonation works, had a radius of 600 metres. The expert confirmed his conclusions at a court meeting on 24 January 2002..  In a judgment of 27 June 2003 the Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s action. It considered it established that the applicant’s property had been seriously damaged and that the damage had coincided in time with the beginning of detonation works in the mine. Still, it concluded that the applicant had not proven that a causal link existed between the damage and the detonations. He had relied in that regard on the witness testimony provided by two neighbours, but according to the Regional Court it was impossible to establish what had caused the damage to the property by way of witness testimony. The burden of proof to establish such a circumstance lay on the applicant and the other party had argued that the damage had been due to the manner of construction of his house..  The applicant lodged an appeal. Before the Sofia Court of Appeal (“the Court of Appeal”) he called an additional witness, who stated during a hearing on 2 February 2004 that many houses in the area had already collapsed, and that all the other houses in the applicant’s neighbourhood had cracks..  On 25 June 2004 the Court of Appeal upheld the Regional Court’s judgment, confirming its reasoning. It held that while witness testimony could establish the extent and the timing of the damage to the applicant’s property, it could not prove the causal link between that damage and the detonation works at the mine..  The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. In a judgment of 5 April 2006 the Supreme Court of Cassation quashed the Court of Appeal’s judgment and remitted the case for fresh examination. It was of the view that the lower courts had not duly accounted for the fact that the mine operated in a prohibited area close to the applicant’s house, the house being situated within both the “sanitation zone” and the “security zone” around the mine. The lower courts had had to examine this fact in light of the statements of the witnesses, which had “established the circumstance” that the damage to the applicant’s property had been the result of the detonation works. It was also necessary to assess compliance by the company operating the mine with other statutory requirements, such as those concerning environmental protection..  After the case was remitted, the Court of Appeal commissioned a new expert report. The expert noted that, owing to the passage of time and the destruction of some documents, it was impossible to determine the exact distance between the applicant’s house and the area where the detonations had been carried out in 1997. Nevertheless, it was clear that the house had been well inside the “sanitation zone” around the mine. The expert additionally noted that the detonations had been carried out by qualified workers, in accordance with the mine’s internal rules..  The Court of Appeal heard an additional witness for the applicant, who stated during a court hearing of 23 November 2006 that many houses in the village had collapsed, and that he thought that this was due to the detonations at the mine. He added that the detonations took place on a daily basis, that they caused “earthquakes”, and that the houses shattered as a result. The first cracks on the applicant’s house had appeared even before the time when the mine had operated closest to it. The witness was not aware of any landslides in the area..  In a judgment of 2 April 2007 the Court of Appeal once again upheld the Regional Court’s judgment of 27 June 2003, dismissing the applicant’s claim. It found it “indisputable” that employees of the mine had acted in breach of law, by carrying out detonations in a prohibited area close to residential buildings, including at the time when, according to the applicant, the damage to his property had started. Nevertheless, on the basis of the material submitted, the applicant had not proved the causal link between the mine’s work and the damage to his property. The Court of Appeal reasoned in that regard:\n",
      "“The causal link ... cannot be assumed – it is to be fully proven by the claimant. It has not been shown in the case that the claimant’s building, constructed in the 1950s, has been damaged precisely because of the detonation works at the mine. The claimant has not shown that the residential building and the auxiliary buildings, given [their] manner of construction, the materials [used] and the time of [their] construction, would not have been damaged, or would not have been damaged to such an extent, had it not been for the detonation works at the mine. It has not been shown whether and to what degree the buildings’ state described by the expert [heard by the Regional Court] was due to normal wear and tear, taking into account the year [they were built] and the manner of [their] construction, and any lack of maintenance by the owner after the 1990 expropriation.”.  Upon a further appeal by the applicant, in a final judgment of 3 July 2008 the Supreme Court of Cassation upheld the Court of Appeal’s judgment, affirming its conclusions. It pointed out in particular that the expert report presented to the Court of Appeal (see paragraph 18 above) had only established that the applicant’s property had been situated within the “sanitation zone” around the mine, but “was insufficient to prove the existence of a causal link between the damage ... and the unlawful behaviour of employees of the respondent company”..  In the meantime, the applicant’s house has collapsed and no longer exists. The property has been abandoned.\n",

      "The first, second and third applicants were born in 1971, 1947 and [[1954]] respectively, and live in Budapest.. The second and third applicants, as well as the legal predecessors of the first and third applicant (Ms Róbertné Hidas and Ms Miklósné Kecskés) and other persons were [[co-owners]] of a [[plot]] of [[land]] of [[4]],847 sq. m ([[land]] registry title no. 223591) in District XXII of Budapest. They also co‑[[owned]] a neighbouring [[plot]] of [[land]] of 423 sq. m ([[land]] registry title no. 223592).. [[On]] 19 January 1998 the Budapest District XXII Mayor’s Office (hereafter “the local [[authority]]”) ordered the partition of [[plot]] no. 223591 into two plots measuring 1,519 sq. m and 3,328 sq. m. [[In]] the same decision, it requisitioned (lejegyzés) the [[plot]] of 1,519 sq. m for the purpose of constructing a local public road and [[awarded]] [[compensation]] of [[5]],511,000 Hungarian forints (HUF – approximately 25,000 European Currency [[Units]] (ECU) (the predecessor to the euro) at the material time), to be distributed among the owners in proportion to their ownership shares.. At the same time, the [[local]] authority also partitioned plot no. 223592 and requisitioned a part of that land with an area of 123 sq. m in exchange for compensation of HUF 376,200 (approximately ECU 1,700).. The decisions were served on the first applicant’s legal predecessor, the second applicant, the third applicant and the third applicant’s legal predecessor, among other persons. They appealed against it.. On [[6]] March 1998 the Budapest Public Administration Office (Budapest Főváros Közigazgatási Hivatala) upheld the first-instance decisions, which thus became [[final]]..  On 25 March 1998 the [[local]] authority entered into possession of the requisitioned plots of land and paid the compensation to the applicants, who only provisionally accepted the sum, while reserving their right to bring court proceedings against the requisition [[orders]]..  On 13 April 1998 some of the [[above-mentioned]] owners challenged the administrative decisions in court. The legal predecessor of the first applicant and the second applicant himself were parties to the proceedings, but not the third applicant or his [[legal]] predecessor..  On 16 March 2005, following two remittals ordered by the Budapest Court of Appeal, the Budapest High Court delivered a first-instance judgment and dismissed the claim..  On 30 November 2005 the Budapest Court of Appeal overturned the first-instance judgment and ordered new administrative proceedings. It held that the [[local]] authority’s decision had been tainted by a procedural irregularity, in that the [[local]] authority’s notary (who had adopted the decision of 19 January 1998) should have abstained from taking a decision in a case in which the [[local]] authority employing him had been one of the interested parties..  Accordingly, the Budapest District XI Mayor’s Office was appointed to conduct new first-instance [[administrative]] proceedings. [[On]] 7 February 2008 it adopted a decision identical to that of 19 January 1998 (see [[paragraph]] [[7]] above)..  On 2 July 2008 the decision was upheld on appeal by the Public Administration Office of Budapest, with an amendment that the [[compensation]] figures should be increased by [[accrued]] [[interest]]..  On 27 August 2008 the first applicant challenged the new administrative decision in court. The second and third applicants intervened (beavatkozó) in the proceedings in support of the first applicant..  [[On]] 11 March 2010 the Budapest High Court found for the applicants, quashed the administrative decision because it had been adopted on the basis of a legal provision previously annulled by the Constitutional Court, and ordered [[new]] proceedings..  On 10 January 2015 the [[Budapest]] Government Office (Budapest Főváros Kormányhivatala) adopted a new administrative decision, with the same content as before, but on different [[legal]] grounds..  [[On]] [[9]] February 2015 the applicants brought court proceedings against that decision..  On 19 [[April]] 2016 the Budapest Administrative and Labour Court delivered its judgment. It dismissed the applicants’ action as far as the requisition’s lawfulness was concerned but quashed the administrative decision as regards the [[compensation]] amount. It held that the [[compensation]] amount should be set at such sum as reflected by an assessment of the [[value]] of the properties as at 2015 and that the assessment should be carried out in accordance with the provisions of Government Decree no. 58/2015 (III.24). [[The]] government decree in question contained a table for the purposes of [[calculating]] social [[security]] [[pensions]]. In that table, different multiplication factors were associated with different years (from [[1950]] onwards), making it thus possible to calculate the current [[value]] of salaries and incomes received during [[previous]] employment..  On 14 June [[2017]] the Kúria quashed the final judgment and remitted the [[case]] to the Budapest [[Administrative]] and Labour Court for the recalculation of the compensation amount. It held that the method of [[assessing]] the valuations applied in the first-instance judgment could not be used in the context of the case; instead, the amount to be paid should be calculated by an expert on the basis of the [[properties]]’ market [[values]] on 10 January 2015, from which the compensation already received in 1998 (see paragraph 10 above) should be deducted..  Throughout the court proceedings, the Land Registry has retained a record of the dispute (perfeljegyzés)..  The public road contemplated by the local authority’s requisition order of [[1998]] (see paragraph 7 above) has yet to be constructed. [[At]] the date of the latest [[information]] available to the Court (2 October [[2018]]), the [[proceedings]] concerning the amount of compensation due to the applicants were still pending before the domestic courts.\n",

On 30 November 2005 the Budapest Court of Appeal overturned the first-instance judgment and ordered new administrative proceedings. It held that the [[locally]] authority’s decision had been tainted by a procedural irregularity, in that the [[locally]] authority’s notary (who had adopted the decision of 19 January 1998) should have abstained from taking a decision in a case in which the [[locally]] authority employing him had been one of the interested parties..  Accordingly, the Budapest District XI Mayor’s Office was appointed to conduct new first-instance [[managerial]] proceedings. [[For]] 7 February 2008 it adopted a decision identical to that of 19 January 1998 (see [[paagraph]] [[𝟕]] above)..  On 2 July 2008 the decision was upheld on appeal by the Public Administration Office of Budapest, with an amendment that the [[cmopensation]] figures should be increased by [[amassed]] [[sake]]..  On 27 August 2008 the first applicant challenged the new administrative decision in court. The second and third applicants intervened (beavatkozó) in the proceedings in support of the first applicant..  [[For]] 11 March 2010 the Budapest High Court found for the applicants, quashed the administrative decision because it had been adopted on the basis of a legal provision previously annulled by the Constitutional Court, and ordered [[newer]] proceedings..  On 10 January 2015 the [[Hungarian]] Government Office (Budapest Főváros Kormányhivatala) adopted a new administrative decision, with the same content as before, but on different [[judicial]] grounds..  [[For]] [[৭]] February 2015 the applicants brought court proceedings against that decision..  On 19 [[Apirl]] 2016 the Budapest Administrative and Labour Court delivered its judgment. It dismissed the applicants’ action as far as the requisition’s lawfulness was concerned but quashed the administrative decision as regards the [[compensaiton]] amount. It held that the [[compensating]] amount should be set at such sum as reflected by an assessment of the [[vale]] of the properties as at 2015 and that the assessment should be carried out in accordance with the provisions of Government Decree no. 58/2015 (III.24). [[De]] government decree in question contained a table for the purposes of [[calculates]] social [[secure]] [[retired]]. In that table, different multiplication factors were associated with different years (from [[19]] [[50]] onwards), making it thus possible to calculate the current [[valor]] of salaries and incomes received during [[previously]] employment..  On 14 June [[20]] [[17]] the Kúria quashed the final judgment and remitted the [[instances]] to the Budapest [[Management]] and Labour Court for the recalculation of the compensation amount. It held that the method of [[appraisal]] the valuations applied in the first-instance judgment could not be used in the context of the case; instead, the amount to be paid should be calculated by an expert on the basis of the [[possessions]]’ market [[valor]] on 10 January 2015, from which the compensation already received in 1998 (see paragraph 10 above) should be deducted..  Throughout the court proceedings, the Land Registry has retained a record of the dispute (perfeljegyzés)..  The public road contemplated by the local authority’s requisition order of [[19]] [[98]] (see paragraph 7 above) has yet to be constructed. [[During]] the date of the latest [[informational]] available to the Court (2 October [[20]] [[18]]), the [[lawsuits]] concerning the amount of compensation due to the applicants were still pending before the domestic courts.\n",

In addition, [[the]] [[Regional]] Court [[considered]] [[that]] [[a]] [[conviction]] [[for]] [[a]] third [[case]] [[of]] [[drug]] smuggling [[could]] [[not]] [[be]] envisaged [[for]] the sole [[reason]] that the [[precise]] [[amount]] of cocaine transported [[in]] [[a]] [[suitcase]] [[from]] [[Peru]] [[to]] Spain [[could]] [[not]] [[be]] [[determined]]..  The [[applicant]] submitted [[that]] his daughter and [[her]] [[mother]] [[had]] visited [[him]] in [[prison]] [[from]] 2001 to 2003 [[and]] [[that]] [[he]] [[had]] sought [[a]] [[court]] [[ruling]] on [[contact]] with his [[daughter]], [[when]] [[the]] child’s [[mother]] [[discontinued]] [[the]] [[visits]]. [[On]] 4 [[July]] [[2006]], [[the]] [[applicant]] and the child’[[s]] [[mother]] agreed [[before]] [[the]] Munich [[Family]] [[Court]] that [[supervised]] [[meetings]] [[between]] [[him]] and [[his]] daughter [[would]] take place [[as]] [[soon]] [[as]] he [[was]] [[released]] [[from]] prison. As [[of]] [[31]] January 2008, [[the]] daughter visited the [[applicant]] regularly [[in]] [[prison]] – [[every]] four [[weeks]] [[for]] two hours at a [[time]] – [[in]] [[the]] company of [[a]] priest..  [[On]] [[3]] July 2009 the applicant was [[released]], after having [[served]] [[his]] [[entire]] [[sentence]]. He [[was]] placed [[under]] [[supervision]] of conduct ([[Führungsaufsicht]]) until [[3]] July [[2013]]..  [[After]] his release, the [[applicant]] [[was]] [[granted]] [[exceptional]] leave [[to]] [[remain]] (Duldung) under [[Section]] 60a [[of]] [[the]] [[Residence]] [[Act]] – [[according]] [[to]] [[the]] [[information]] [[available]] [[to]] [[the]] [[Court]] [[this]] was granted [[most]] [[recently]] in [[January]] [[2017]] [[and]] [[would]] last [[until]] [[July]] 2017. [[It]] meant [[that]] enforcement [[of]] [[the]] expulsion [[order]] was temporarily suspended, [[being]] [[impossible]] to [[execute]] [[as]] [[the]] [[applicant]] did not [[have]] [[a]] [[valid]] [[passport]] ([[see]] [[paragraphs]] [[28]], [[29]] [[and]] [[36]]‑[[42]] below). [[He]] began occupational [[re-training]] [[as]] a [[management]] [[assistant]] [[in]] [[marketing]] [[communication]] in [[April]] [[2010]], which [[he]] successfully [[completed]] [[in]] [[June]] [[2012]], [[but]] was [[not]] allowed [[to]] [[engage]] in gainful [[employment]] since [[his]] release..  [[The]] [[applicant]] [[has]] [[not]] [[lived]] [[with]] [[his]] [[daughter]] [[and]] [[her]] mother [[since]] [[his]] [[release]]. [[Since]] [[2012]] [[they]] [[have]] [[been]] [[living]] [[in]] different cities, [[with]] distances between [[their]] homes [[varying]] between thirty [[and]] [[seventy]] kilometres and [[the]] [[travelling]] [[time]] [[varying]] [[between]] [[forty]] minutes [[and]] [[one]] [[hour]]. [[The]] applicant sees his [[daughter]] [[on]] a [[regular]] basis [[and]] maintains close contact with [[her]]. It is [[not]] [[disputed]] [[between]] the parties [[that]] [[she]] [[spends]] [[every]] [[other]] weekend [[with]] [[him]]. [[According]] to [[a]] social [[worker]]’s [[statement]], [[he]] [[has]] [[become]] [[an]] important [[contact]] person [[for]] her. [[Both]] [[the]] [[applicant]]’s [[daughter]] [[and]] her mother explicitly [[wish]] [[the]] applicant’s [[contact]] [[with]] his [[child]] [[to]] [[continue]]..  Since [[his]] [[release]], the [[applicant]] was convicted [[of]] [[three]] offences by [[the]] Munich [[District]] [[Court]], [[of]] fraud [[in]] [[2011]] [[and]] of [[theft]] [[in]] [[2015]] and 2016. [[He]] [[was]] [[sentenced]] [[to]] twenty, [[thirty]] and [[ninety]] [[day-fines]], respectively. By being [[present]] [[on]] German territory [[without]] [[having]] [[a]] [[passport]], [[he]] committed [[an]] [[ongoing]] [[offence]] under the [[Residence]] Act. [[Criminal]] proceedings in [[this]] connection were [[discontinued]] by [[the]] [[public]] [[prosecutor]] [[in]] [[November]] [[2013]] because [[the]] [[applicant]]’[[s]] [[guilt]] [[was]] considered [[to]] [[be]] [[of]] a minor nature and [[because]] [[prosecution]] [[was]] not [[in]] the [[public]] [[interest]]. The [[matter]] [[was]] [[referred]] to [[the]] administrative [[authority]] [[for]] treatment as an administrative [[offence]]..  On 21 [[March]] [[2003]] [[the]] Authority [[of]] the [[City]] [[of]] Munich refused [[to]] [[renew]] the [[applicant]]’[[s]] [[residence]] [[permit]] [[and]] [[ordered]] his [[expulsion]]. It held [[that]] [[the]] [[applicant]]’[[s]] expulsion [[was]] [[mandatory]] [[pursuant]] [[to]] [[Section]] [[47]] § 1 [[of]] [[the]] Aliens [[Act]] ([[Ausländergesetz]]; [[since]] [[2004]]: [[Section]] [[53]] of the [[Residence]] Act) which [[foresaw]] [[the]] [[mandatory]] [[expulsion]] [[of]] [[an]] [[alien]] if he [[or]] she were sentenced to [[either]] [[at]] [[least]] [[three]] [[years]]’ [[imprisonment]] [[for]] [[a]] criminal [[offence]], [[or]] [[to]] any [[period]] [[of]] [[imprisonment]] ([[not]] [[on]] probation) [[for]] [[an]] offence under [[the]] [[Narcotics]] [[Act]]. [[The]] [[authority]] [[examined]] [[whether]] the [[applicant]] [[enjoyed]] [[special]] [[protection]] [[against]] expulsion [[because]] he [[was]] the father [[of]] [[a]] [[German]] child. It found [[that]] [[the]] [[applicant]] [[had]] lived with [[his]] [[daughter]] [[only]] for [[a]] [[short]] [[time]] prior [[to]] his imprisonment, [[she]] [[had]] thus [[experienced]] separation from the [[applicant]] and that, [[in]] [[the]] light of [[the]] applicant’[[s]] [[very]] serious [[criminal]] offences, the [[State]]’s [[interest]] in [[removing]] the applicant [[prevailed]] [[over]] [[his]] [[interest]] in [[enjoying]] family life [[with]] [[his]] [[daughter]]. He could remain [[in]] contact with her [[by]] [[letter]] or [[telephone]] and [[could]] [[apply]] [[for]] permission [[to]] [[enter]] [[Germany]] [[for]] [[specific]] periods [[of]] [[time]] ([[Betretenserlaubnis]]). [[It]] [[considered]] [[that]] the [[applicant]]’s expulsion was [[in]] [[conformity]] [[with]] [[Article]] [[8]] § [[2]] [[of]] [[the]] [[Convention]]. [[This]] [[decision]], which [[also]] [[contained]] an unlimited [[re-entry]] [[ban]] and notice [[that]] he [[would]] be [[deported]] to [[Nigeria]] [[if]] [[he]] [[did]] not leave Germany [[voluntarily]] [[within]] four [[weeks]] [[after]] [[being]] [[released]] [[from]] [[prison]], became [[final]] on [[26]] [[August]] 2003..  [[On]] 15 [[November]] [[2006]], [[after]] the applicant had [[served]] more [[than]] [[two]] [[thirds]] [[of]] his [[prison]] sentence, [[the]] [[authorities]] envisaged [[his]] expulsion [[as]] [[of]] [[1]] [[November]] [[2007]]..  [[On]] [[3]] December 2007 the [[applicant]] introduced [[another]] [[asylum]] [[application]] (see [[paragraph]] 6 [[above]]). [[On]] [[8]] [[February]] 2008, the [[Federal]] [[Office]] for [[Migration]] [[and]] Refugees dismissed [[his]] application as [[manifestly]] ill‑[[founded]] [[under]] Section [[30]] § [[3]] of [[the]] Asylum [[Procedure]] Act (see [[paragraph]] [[33]] [[below]]) and, [[finding]] that there [[were]] no [[impediments]] [[to]] [[his]] [[return]] to his [[country]] [[of]] [[origin]], ordered his expulsion. [[The]] decision [[again]] [[contained]] notice [[that]] [[he]] [[would]] [[be]] deported to Nigeria [[if]] he did [[not]] [[leave]] Germany [[voluntarily]] [[within]] [[one]] [[week]] [[after]] [[the]] [[decision]] became final. [[On]] [[6]] [[March]] [[2008]], [[the]] Munich [[Administrative]] Court [[granted]] [[suspensive]] effect [[to]] [[the]] [[applicant]]’s [[appeal]] [[in]] the asylum [[procedure]]. [[On]] [[8]] September 2009 [[it]] [[dismissed]] [[his]] [[appeal]] [[in]] the main procedure, also [[finding]], inter alia, [[that]] [[the]] [[applicant]]’s ties to his [[daughter]] [[could]] [[not]] be [[taken]] [[into]] [[account]] [[in]] the [[asylum]] procedure. [[This]] decision became [[final]] [[on]] [[1]] [[December]] [[2009]]..  On 10 [[September]] 2009 the [[applicant]] applied for a residence [[permit]] [[based]] [[on]] family [[ties]]..  [[On]] 9 [[February]] 2010 the [[Authority]] [[of]] [[the]] [[City]] of [[Munich]] rejected his application, [[holding]] that there was [[a]] [[final]] [[expulsion]] [[decision]] ([[of]] 21 March [[2003]]) [[against]] [[the]] applicant, which [[precluded]] granting [[him]] [[a]] [[residence]] permit. [[No]] [[impediments]] [[arose]] [[from]] the [[fact]] [[that]] his daughter was [[a]] [[German]] [[national]]. The [[applicant]] could [[maintain]] [[contact]] [[with]] [[her]] through [[letters]], [[telephone]] [[calls]] [[and]] occasional visits. His daughter [[was]] [[accustomed]] [[to]] a [[long-distance]] relationship [[with]] him. He [[was]] responsible [[for]] [[the]] [[renewed]] separation [[and]] [[the]] [[purpose]] [[of]] [[the]] expulsion [[order]] had not [[yet]] [[been]] achieved. At the [[same]] time, [[it]] [[reduced]] the [[re-entry]] ban to five years [[and]] [[ruled]] [[that]] the [[applicant]] could, [[starting]] [[one]] [[year]] [[after]] his [[actual]] [[expulsion]], apply for permission [[to]] enter [[Germany]] twice a [[year]] for [[a]] [[total]] of [[four]] weeks..  [[On]] [[14]] [[April]] [[2010]] [[the]] Munich Administrative Court [[quashed]] [[that]] decision and [[ordered]] the administrative authority to [[issue]] [[a]] [[residence]] permit. It [[noted]] [[that]] [[the]] [[applicant]] met [[the]] [[requirements]] for a [[residence]] [[permit]] [[based]] [[on]] [[family]] [[ties]], [[but]] [[that]] [[granting]] such [[a]] permit was [[precluded]] by [[the]] final expulsion decision. [[However]], [[the]] [[applicant]] was [[entitled]] to [[a]] residence permit [[on]] humanitarian [[grounds]] [[in]] [[accordance]] [[with]] Section 25 § [[5]] [[of]] [[the]] [[Residence]] [[Act]], [[with]] [[the]] [[margin]] of [[appreciation]] [[inherent]] [[in]] [[this]] [[provision]] [[being]] reduced [[to]] zero. [[Section]] 11 § [[1]] [[of]] [[the]] Residence Act [[was]] not applicable [[to]] this provision [[and]] the [[applicant]]’[[s]] [[departure]] [[was]] [[impossible]] [[in]] [[law]] [[due]] [[to]] [[his]] family [[life]] [[with]] his daughter, [[which]] [[was]] [[protected]], [[inter]] [[alia]], [[by]] [[Article]] [[8]] [[of]] [[the]] [[Convention]]..  The Administrative Court [[found]] [[that]], [[despite]] [[the]] [[serious]] [[nature]] of [[the]] criminal [[offences]] the [[applicant]] had [[committed]], [[there]] [[was]] no [[public]] interest that [[outweighed]] [[the]] [[child]]’[[s]] [[best]] [[interests]] [[and]] the [[applicant]]’s [[interest]] in [[having]] contact with [[his]] [[daughter]]. The [[relationship]] between [[the]] applicant and [[his]] [[daughter]] had [[the]] [[quality]] [[of]] a “[[family]]” and [[their]] [[ties]] [[were]] of [[benefit]] [[to]] [[the]] child. It [[considered]] [[that]] they [[could]] [[only]] [[live]] [[together]] in [[Germany]], as the [[child]] [[could]] not [[be]] [[expected]] to [[relocate]] to [[Nigeria]]; [[that]] the [[applicant]] [[had]] committed the [[criminal]] [[offences]] [[prior]] to [[the]] [[birth]] of [[his]] daughter; [[that]] he had [[made]] considerable efforts [[as]] a [[father]], [[as]] was also [[evidenced]] [[by]] his [[choice]] [[to]] remain imprisoned [[in]] [[Germany]] [[and]] to have supervised [[meetings]] with his daughter [[as]] of [[January]] [[2008]] [[rather]] [[than]] having his sentence [[suspended]] [[and]] [[being]] expelled [[as]] of [[1]] [[November]] [[2007]]; [[that]] [[the]] [[latter]] [[event]] [[marked]] [[a]] turning point, [[which]] occurred after the [[expulsion]] order [[had]] [[become]] [[final]] [[in]] [[2003]] [[and]] [[which]] [[had]] not been [[taken]] [[into]] [[account]] by [[the]] [[administrative]] [[authorities]]; that [[the]] child [[had]] already [[been]] [[deprived]] [[of]] a [[relationship]] [[with]] [[her]] [[father]] [[for]] many [[years]] [[during]] his [[imprisonment]]; that [[the]] [[material]] assessment with a [[view]] [[to]] [[the]] [[applicant]]’[[s]] expulsion had [[been]] conducted on 21 March 2003, [[years]] [[before]] [[the]] [[developments]] [[in]] [[the]] father‑daughter [[relationship]] [[and]] [[the]] [[moment]] the [[expulsion]] order would [[be]] [[enforced]]; [[and]] that the enforcement [[of]] [[the]] expulsion order [[in]] [[connection]] [[with]] a [[re-entry]] ban [[would]] [[deprive]] [[the]] child of the [[possibility]] [[of]] [[a]] [[normal]] [[father-daughter]] relationship [[for]] [[the]] [[remainder]] [[of]] her childhood..  [[On]] [[27]] [[June]] 2011 [[the]] [[Bavarian]] [[Administrative]] [[Court]] [[of]] [[Appeal]] [[overturned]] that judgment [[and]] [[denied]] [[the]] [[applicant]]’[[s]] right to a residence [[permit]]. [[It]] [[considered]] [[that]] [[his]] [[asylum]] application had [[been]] rejected as [[manifestly]] ill-founded [[under]] [[Section]] [[30]] § [[3]] [[of]] the Asylum [[Procedure]] [[Act]] [[and]] that, [[therefore]], in [[accordance]] with [[Section]] [[10]] § [[3]], [[second]] [[sentence]], [[of]] the [[Residence]] Act, [[he]] could [[not]] [[be]] [[granted]] [[a]] residence permit [[prior]] [[to]] [[leaving]] [[Germany]] ([[see]] [[paragraph]] [[33]] below). [[The]] [[exception]] to this [[rule]], foreseen [[in]] [[the]] third [[sentence]] of [[this]] [[paragraph]], was not [[applicable]] [[because]] [[the]] [[applicant]] [[did]] not [[have]] a claim [[to]] a residence [[permit]] within [[the]] meaning [[of]] [[that]] [[provision]] ([[see]] paragraph [[34]] [[below]])..  First, a claim to a residence permit based [[on]] [[family]] ties under [[Sections]] [[27]] [[et]] [[seq]]. [[of]] the Residence Act [[was]] [[precluded]] by [[Section]] 11 [[of]] the Residence Act [[due]] to [[the]] [[final]] expulsion [[order]] of 21 March 2003 ([[see]] paragraph 35 [[below]]). [[Second]], a [[claim]] to [[a]] [[residence]] permit [[on]] [[humanitarian]] [[grounds]] under [[Section]] 25 § [[5]] [[of]] the [[Residence]] Act [[was]] [[proscribed]] [[because]] [[the]] applicant did [[not]] [[have]] [[a]] valid [[passport]], [[which]] [[was]] [[a]] general [[requirement]] [[for]] the [[granting]] [[of]] [[a]] [[residence]] [[permit]] ([[see]] paragraph [[32]] [[below]]). [[As]] the [[decision]] to [[waive]] this requirement [[in]] [[cases]] [[concerning]] residence [[permits]] [[on]] [[humanitarian]] [[grounds]] [[was]] [[a]] [[discretionary]] [[one]], [[the]] [[applicant]] [[did]] [[not]] have a [[claim]] [[to]] a residence [[permit]] within [[the]] meaning [[of]] Section [[10]] § [[3]], [[third]] sentence, of [[the]] [[Residence]] Act, [[not]] even [[if]] [[the]] [[margin]] [[of]] appreciation [[were]] reduced to [[zero]] ([[see]] paragraph 34 [[below]]). [[Third]], [[the]] court found that the [[applicant]] [[could]] [[not]] [[base]] [[a]] claim to a [[residence]] permit [[on]] [[impediments]] [[to]] his [[return]] to [[his]] [[country]] [[of]] [[origin]] [[either]], [[referring]] [[to]] the [[outcome]] [[of]] the asylum [[proceedings]] [[in]] 2008 and [[2009]] (see paragraph 18 [[above]]). The [[Court]] [[of]] [[Appeal]] [[concluded]] [[that]], under [[these]] [[circumstances]], [[it]] was [[not]] decisive [[whether]] [[the]] ties [[between]] [[the]] [[applicant]] and his [[daughter]] [[were]] [[such]] [[that]] the [[requirements]] [[for]] a residence [[permit]] [[on]] [[humanitarian]] [[grounds]] [[under]] [[Section]] 25 § [[5]] of [[the]] Residence [[Act]] were [[met]], [[if]] [[the]] [[applicant]]’s asylum [[application]] had not [[been]] [[dismissed]], [[and]] refrained [[from]] elaborating on [[this]] [[aspect]]..  [[On]] 12 [[September]] [[2011]] [[the]] [[applicant]] [[lodged]] [[an]] [[action]] to [[be]] [[granted]] leave [[to]] appeal on points of [[law]], [[arguing]] [[that]] his [[case]] raised [[a]] [[matter]] [[of]] [[fundamental]] importance. [[He]] [[submitted]] [[that]] he should be [[granted]] a [[residence]] [[permit]] [[under]] [[Section]] [[25]] § 5 of the [[Residence]] [[Act]] because, as [[the]] [[father]] [[of]] a minor child [[of]] [[German]] nationality for [[whom]] he had joint [[custody]], [[he]] [[did]], in principle, [[have]] [[a]] [[claim]] to a residence [[permit]] [[based]] [[on]] [[family]] [[ties]]. The purpose of [[Section]] 10 § [[3]] [[of]] [[the]] [[Residence]] [[Act]] [[was]] [[to]] sanction [[abuse]] [[of]] [[the]] asylum [[procedure]], [[but]] an abusive asylum application [[should]] [[not]] [[bear]] negative [[consequences]] where the [[foreigner]] [[had]] a [[claim]], [[within]] [[the]] [[meaning]] of [[that]] [[provision]], to [[a]] residence [[permit]]. [[In]] [[that]] [[regard]], [[it]] [[should]] [[be]] [[decisive]] [[whether]] [[or]] [[not]] [[the]] [[substantive]] [[requirements]] of [[the]] respective [[provision]] [[for]] a residence [[permit]] [[were]] [[met]], [[as]] [[in]] [[his]] [[case]] [[with]] [[regard]] to the permit [[based]] [[on]] family [[ties]], [[and]] [[that]] [[the]] [[reason]] [[for]] the [[claim]] [[not]] [[being]] realised, in [[his]] case [[the]] final expulsion [[order]] against [[him]], [[should]] [[not]] be relevant..  [[On]] 16 [[February]] 2012 [[the]] [[Federal]] Administrative [[Court]] [[rejected]] [[the]] [[applicant]]’[[s]] [[action]]. It noted [[that]], according [[to]] the [[case-law]] of [[the]] domestic courts, [[the]] exception foreseen in [[Section]] [[10]] § 3, [[third]] [[sentence]], [[of]] [[the]] [[Residence]] Act [[only]] [[applied]] [[to]] [[claims]] that [[followed]] directly [[from]] [[legislative]] [[provisions]] [[and]] in [[respect]] [[of]] which all requirements, general [[and]] specific, [[were]] met. [[A]] [[residence]] permit [[based]] on family [[ties]] [[was]] [[precluded]] because [[of]] [[the]] [[final]] expulsion order [[against]] [[the]] [[applicant]]. [[Under]] these [[circumstances]], [[granting]] a [[residence]] permit on humanitarian grounds was to [[be]] considered. [[However]], [[as]] the [[applicant]] [[did]] [[not]] [[have]] [[a]] valid passport, which [[was]] [[a]] [[general]] requirement for [[the]] granting [[of]] [[a]] residence permit [[from]] [[which]] [[derogations]] were, [[in]] [[cases]] [[concerning]] [[Section]] 25 § 5 of [[the]] Residence Act, [[possible]] only by way of [[a]] [[discretionary]] [[decision]], the exception [[foreseen]] [[in]] [[Section]] [[10]] § 3, [[third]] sentence, of the [[Residence]] [[Act]] was not applicable. [[The]] [[decision]] [[was]] [[served]] [[on]] the applicant [[on]] 22 [[February]] [[2012]]..  [[On]] [[22]] March 2012 the [[applicant]] [[lodged]] a [[constitutional]] complaint with [[the]] [[Federal]] [[Constitutional]] [[Court]], alleging [[that]] [[the]] [[decisions]] of [[the]] [[Administrative]] Court of [[Appeal]] and of [[the]] [[Federal]] [[Administrative]] [[Court]] violated [[his]] [[right]] to [[respect]] for [[his]] [[family]] [[life]] with his daughter. [[On]] [[18]] July [[2012]] the [[Federal]] [[Constitutional]] [[Court]] [[declined]] [[to]] [[accept]] the [[applicant]]’[[s]] constitutional complaint without providing [[reasons]] (no. [[2]] [[BvR]] 657/12)..  [[After]] the [[Authority]] [[of]] [[the]] [[City]] of [[Munich]], [[on]] 12 June 2012, [[had]] ordered [[the]] [[applicant]] [[to]] [[present]] himself [[to]] the Embassy [[of]] Nigeria in [[Germany]] so [[that]] [[a]] passport [[for]] [[the]] [[upcoming]] expulsion [[could]] be [[issued]], [[the]] applicant [[refused]] [[to]] [[do]] so and [[filed]] [[an]] action [[against]] [[this]] [[order]] [[with]] [[the]] Munich Administrative Court. [[During]] the court hearing [[on]] [[1]] [[August]] 2012, [[the]] [[applicant]] and [[the]] [[immigration]] [[authorities]] agreed [[to]] [[the]] [[following]]:\n",
      "“- [[The]] effect [[of]] [[the]] [[re-entry]] [[ban]] [[will]] [[be]] [[limited]] [[to]] [[two]] and [[a]] half [[years]] after leaving Germany.\n",
      "- The [[immigration]] authorities [[will]] [[give]] their [[consent]] for [[a]] [[visa]] to [[enter]] Germany based on [[family]] [[reunion]]. [[If]] [[the]] [[applicant]] [[by]] [[then]] [[still]] has [[joint]] [[custody]] [[with]] [[the]] [[child]]’[[s]] [[mother]], a residence [[permit]] [[on]] the [[grounds]] [[of]] family [[ties]] will be [[issued]]. [[If]] the [[applicant]] [[no]] longer [[has]] [[joint]] custody [[for]] his daughter, [[the]] immigration [[authority]] [[will]] [[use]] its [[discretion]] regarding the issue [[of]] [[a]] residence permit in favour [[of]] [[the]] applicant.\n",
      "- [[All]] [[of]] [[this]] [[applies]] [[only]] if the [[applicant]] [[can]] [[show]] [[that]] [[he]] has [[not]] committed [[further]] [[criminal]] offences and if [[no]] [[other]] [[reasons]] for [[his]] [[expulsion]] emerge.\n",
      "- [[A]] [[time]]‑[[limit]] [[for]] [[leaving]] the [[country]] is [[set]] at 1 [[November]] 2012.”\n",
      "In [[the]] light [[of]] this [[agreement]], the [[applicant]] [[withdrew]] his [[action]], [[and]] the proceedings [[before]] [[the]] Munich [[Administrative]] [[Court]] [[were]] [[discontinued]]..  On [[25]] [[September]] 2012 [[the]] Embassy of [[Nigeria]] in Germany declared that [[it]] would [[not]] issue [[a]] passport to the applicant [[as]] [[long]] as [[the]] [[proceedings]] before this [[Court]] were [[pending]]. [[On]] 6 [[November]] 2012 [[the]] [[applicant]] informed the [[immigration]] authorities that [[he]] [[would]] [[not]] [[leave]] [[Germany]], contrary [[to]] his [[initial]] plans [[and]] [[to]] [[his]] [[declaration]] [[before]] [[the]] [[Munich]] [[Administrative]] Court.

      "The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Ljubljana.. On 8 October 1992 the applicant became a member of L.E., which was at that time a public limited company operating under Slovenian law. The share capital of L.E. stood at 2,995,250 Slovenian tolars (SIT)[1] and the applicant’s capital contribution was SIT 332,805.55[2] (that is, 11.11% of the company’s share capital). L.E. had nine members in total.. On 2 February 1993 the applicant was employed by company L.E. as head of its IT department. In addition, he provided assistance to the finance director (bookkeeping)..  On 19 February 1993 two key members and directors of company L.E., Mr J. Za. and Mr M. D., died in a car accident. The first one, however, remained registered as a member of L.E. The shares of the second were taken over by Ms D. D. Two other members, Mr J. Zu. and Mr D. P., were seriously injured, but also remained registered as members of L.E. Following those events, the applicant assumed the role of acting director of L.E. on 29 April 1993, and then of managing director on 23 February 1995. In that capacity he acted as the company’s representative..  In 1993 the Slovenian Railways, a statutory company, initiated civil proceedings against L.E., claiming the payment of three sums arising from their business dealings, totalling approximately SIT 5,000,000. The applicant represented L.E. at all hearings held in that case except for the last hearing on 22 November 2000..  On 9 August 1995 Mr M. K., another member of L.E., died, but nevertheless remained registered as a member..  In November 1995 L.E. was aligned with the Companies Act 1993, as required (see paragraph 35 below), and at the same time converted from a public limited company into a limited liability company (see paragraph 33 below). At that time L.E. was already both illiquid and insolvent..  On 6 May 1996 the general meeting of L.E. dismissed the applicant from the post of managing director. Since the members failed to appoint a new director, as required (see paragraph 37 below), the applicant’s dismissal was not entered in the court register and he remained registered as managing director of L.E..  On 19 June 1997, on the applicant’s initiative, the general meeting of L.E. decided to start winding-up proceedings. The applicant made a winding-up petition on behalf of L.E. on 23 June 1997, declaring that the company had been insolvent for some time and that its total debt was SIT 22,393,952. On 16 July 1997 the competent court ordered L.E. to make, within 15 days, the required advance payment to cover the costs of the publication of the winding-up order in the Official Gazette in the amount of SIT 150,000[3]. The applicant alleged that some members of L.E. had refused to contribute to the advance payment and had preferred to wait for the competent court to wind up the company of its own motion, in accordance with the then applicable legislation (see paragraph 40 below)..  On 31 July 1997 the applicant stopped working for L.E..  On 25 September 1997 another member of L.E., Mr J. Zu., died, but nevertheless remained registered as a member..  On 15 October 1997 L.E.’s winding-up petition was rejected for failure to make the required advance payment..  By a judgment of 22 November 2000, the District Court of Ljubljana ordered L.E. to pay the Slovenian Railways the sums claimed plus interest (see paragraph 11 above). L.E. did not appeal; the judgment became final on 12 January 2001..  On the basis of notification from the competent authority that L.E. had not performed any transactions through its bank account in a period of twelve consecutive months, on 19 January 2001 the Ljubljana District Court – acting in its capacity as the registry court – initiated proceedings to strike off the company from the court register pursuant to the Financial Operations of Companies Act 1999 (hereinafter “the FOCA”; paragraphs 41-52 below)..  On the same day, the decision to initiate strike-off proceedings was entered in the court register. The decision was sent to the registered address of L.E., but since no representative of the company was there to receive it, a delivery slip was left in its mailbox, notifying the company that the relevant correspondence could be collected at the post office. On 12 February 2001 the decision was returned to the registry court with the information that the addressee had failed to collect it. The registry court then served it by posting it on its notice board, as provided for by domestic law..  No objection was made to the decision of 19 January 2001, either by L.E. or by its members. Consequently, on 11 May 2001 the registry court issued a decision to strike off L.E. from the court register. The decision was published in the Official Gazette on 30 May 2001[4]. The registry court also attempted to serve the decision on L.E. by sending it to the company’s address, but like the previous decision, it was returned on 4 June 2001 with the information that the addressee had failed to collect it. The decision was again posted on the registry court’s notice board. Neither company L.E. nor any of its members, who were entitled to lodge an appeal against the strike-off decision, appealed against the decision, so on 17 August 2001 it became final..  On 25 September 2001 L.E. was struck off from the court register and thus ceased to exist. Notification of the strike-off was published in the Official Gazette on 6 February 2002[5]. At the time of the strike-off, L.E. had nine registered members (including the applicant). The applicant stated that he had become aware that his company had been struck off on 22 December 2004, when a writ was served on him (see paragraph 24 below)..  On 5 April 2002 the above-mentioned creditor applied to the Ljubljana Local Court for the judgment mentioned in paragraph 19 above to be enforced. On 5 June 2002 the court issued a writ of execution, ordering the seizure and sale of all tangible movable property of the applicant and six other members of L.E. It later revoked the writ in respect of Mr J. Za., Mr M. K. and Mr J. Zu., as they had died (see paragraphs 10, 12 and 17 above). At the request of the creditor, on 30 November 2004 the court expanded the writ, ordering the payment of the judgment debt by direct deduction from the earnings of the applicant and of three other members of L.E. The writ was served on the applicant on 22 December 2004..  On 29 December 2004 the applicant lodged an objection to the writ, arguing that the Local Court had failed to establish his actual role in company L.E. or to acknowledge his status as a passive member (see paragraph 51 below), which would have exonerated him from liability for the debts of the company. He maintained that the creditor’s claim against the company had arisen before he had joined it. Moreover, the applicant was of the view that the onus was on the creditor to establish that he had been an active member of the company. Lastly, he applied for a stay of enforcement..  In its judgment of 12 March 2005, the Ljubljana Local Court found that the onus of proving his status as passive member was on the applicant and that he had failed to prove that he had not been an active member of L.E. The court established that with his 11.11% share in the company, the applicant had enjoyed the rights of a minority member, and furthermore, he had been employed by the company and actively involved in its management since April 1993. In his capacity as acting director and later managing director, he had been authorised to act on behalf of the company. Moreover, even after he had resigned as managing director, he had still been active in the running of the company and had also signed the winding-up petition. Lastly, the court considered that, as a minority member, the applicant could have and should have proposed the appointment of a new director at a general meeting of the company, since pursuant to domestic law all companies had to have a director. For those reasons, the applicant’s objection was rejected. The court also dismissed the applicant’s request for a stay of enforcement, as he had failed to demonstrate that the enforcement would have caused him irreparable or serious damage..  On 9 February 2006 the Ljubljana Higher Court rejected an appeal lodged by the applicant on essentially the same grounds as the first-instance court. It observed, inter alia, that the Constitutional Court had found the measure of lifting the corporate veil under the FOCA to be in line with the principle of the separation of a company’s assets from those of its members and thus consistent with the Constitution. The court considered it irrelevant whether the applicant had become a member of L.E. before or after the creditor’s claim had arisen. Having joined the company, he had assumed its assets as well as its liabilities. It further held that it was not decisive that the applicant had not remained a director of L.E. until the dissolution of that company. What was crucial was that the applicant had been actively involved in its management and that he had had the rights of a minority member pursuant to section 445 of the Companies Act 1993 (see paragraph 37 below). The court noted that, in contrast to section 6 of the Companies Act 1993 which required the creditors of a company to prove that a member of the company had abused the corporate form (see paragraph 34 below), the FOCA had introduced a “non-rebuttable” presumption that the members of a struck-off company were deemed to have undertaken joint and several liability for any outstanding debts of the company. In accordance with the Constitutional Court’s ruling, they could be exonerated from their personal liability only if they demonstrated that they were “passive members” of the company (see paragraphs 46 and 51 below). Lastly, the court took note of the fact that the applicant had indeed made a winding-up petition on behalf of L.E., but it considered this irrelevant because L.E. had at the time failed to make the required advance payment and the petition had therefore been rejected (see paragraphs 15 and 18 above)..  On 5 May 2006 the applicant lodged two constitutional complaints. In one of them, he complained that the decisions rendered in the strike-off proceedings against L.E. had been served on that company alone and not on him personally. In the other one, he complained about the outcome of the enforcement proceedings against him..  On 31 January 2007 the Constitutional Court rejected the applicant’s complaint regarding the strike-off proceedings. The decision was served on the applicant on 5 February 2007. It found that the applicant lacked legal interest in challenging those proceedings, since L.E. had already been struck off from the court register. Consequently, even a positive outcome of the constitutional complaint could not improve the applicant’s position..  On 9 July 2007 the Constitutional Court also rejected the complaint regarding the enforcement proceedings as manifestly ill-founded. It held that the lower courts had correctly applied the Constitutional Court’s criteria for differentiating between active and passive members to the applicant’s individual situation..  In 2010 the judgment of 22 November 2000 was enforced in part by direct deduction from the applicant’s salary. On 23 September 2011 the applicant reached an out-of-court settlement with the creditor and paid the agreed amount. The enforcement proceedings against the applicant were terminated on 28 September 2011. In total, the applicant paid EUR 32,795 to the Slovenian Railways. It is not clear how much other members of L.E. have paid to the Slovenian Railways in this connection.\n",

      "The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Louvencourt.. He was hired in 1976 by the French national railway company (Société nationale des chemins de fer – “the SNCF”), where he last worked as Deputy Head of the Amiens Regional Surveillance Unit. He stated that in 2007 he had complained to senior management about the conduct of one of his subordinates, who, he alleged, had used extreme language when addressing a colleague. The employee in question had then filed a complaint against him, following which the applicant had been charged with making false accusations. The applicant had subsequently been suspended from duty by the SNCF on grounds of that charge.. The proceedings were discontinued a few months later, whereupon the applicant notified his employers of his wish to be reinstated in his former post. He received a reply inviting him to consider appointment to another post, but maintained his original request.. On the day of his reinstatement, on 17 March 2008, the applicant found that his work computer had been seized. After being summoned by his superiors, he was informed on 5 April 2008 that the hard disk on the computer had been analysed and that “address change certificates drawn up for third persons and bearing the Lille General Security Service logo” had been found, as well as a large number of files containing pornographic images and films. It can be seen from the judgment of the Amiens Court of Appeal of 15 December 2010 (see paragraphs 14-15 below) that the person who had replaced the applicant during his suspension from post had found “documents which had caught his attention” on the computer, and that he had alerted his superiors in March 2007 and January 2008..  A request for a written explanation was sent to the applicant on 7 May 2008. He replied that in 2006, following problems with his personal computer, he had transferred the contents of one of his USB keys to his work computer. He added that the files containing pornographic material had been sent to him by people he did not know, via the SNCF’s Intranet..  The applicant was summoned to a disciplinary hearing, which took place on 21 May 2008. On 9 June 2008 he was informed by the “resources management director” of Amiens head office that a proposal had been made to dismiss him from the service and that he would be summoned to appear before the disciplinary board. The board convened on 15 July 2008..  On 17 July 2008 the SNCF regional director decided to dismiss the applicant from the service. His decision was worded as follows:\n",
      "“ ... the analysis of the files stored on the hard disk of [the applicant’s] work computer, used for his professional duties, contained the following:\n",
      "i) change of address certificate, signed in his name, certifying the transfer on 01/11/2003 of Ms Catherine [T.] to the Lille General Security Service; the original certificate, sent to ICF North-East enabled the notice period for vacating her flat to be shortened;\n",
      "ii) change of address certificate, bearing the Ministry of Justice logo, in the name of M. [S.-J.], governor of Fresnes Prison, certifying the transfer of M. [P.] Frédéric to Strasbourg Prison, from 1 November 2006;\n",
      "iii) draft documents drawn up in the name of Michel [V.], director of the SOCRIF, certifying his financial situation with regard to that company;\n",
      "iv) a very large number of files containing pornographic images and films (zoophilia and scatophilia).\n",
      "These facts are in breach of the special obligation of exemplary conduct inherent in the duties formerly performed by him within the General Security Service, and of the following provisions:\n",
      "i) Article 5.2 of the RH 0006 on the principles governing the conduct of SNCF officials;\n",
      "ii) the general security database RG 0029 (information systems security policy – user’s charter);\n",
      "iii) the RA 0024 “code of professional conduct” - conduct to be observed with regard to the company’s information system;\n",
      "iv) Article 441-1 of the Criminal Code.”.  On 28 October 2008 the applicant brought proceedings before the Amiens Industrial Tribunal (conseil des prud’hommes) seeking a ruling that he had been dismissed without genuine or serious cause. On 10 May 2010 the Industrial Tribunal held that the decision dismissing the applicant from the service had been justified and, accordingly, rejected his claims.. On 15 December 2010 the Amiens Court of Appeal upheld the substance of that judgment. It held, in particular, as follows:\n",
      "“ ... [The applicant] submitted that the SNCF had infringed his private life by opening, in his absence, files identified as personal in his computer.\n",
      "As a matter of policy, documents kept by employees in the company’s office, save those identified by them as personal, are presumed to be for professional use, meaning that the employer can have access to them in the employee’s absence.\n",
      "It can be seen from the report drawn up by the SEF that the pornographic photos and videos were found in a file called “fun” stored on a hard disk labelled “D:/personal data”.\n",
      "The SNCF explained, without being challenged, that the “D” drive was called “D:/data” by default and was traditionally used by staff to store their work documents.\n",
      "An employee cannot use an entire hard disk, which is supposed to record professional data, for his or her private use. The SNCF were therefore entitled to consider that the description “personal data” appearing on the hard disk could not validly prohibit their access to it. In any event, the generic term “personal data” could have referred to work files being personally processed by the employee and did not therefore explicitly designate elements relating to his private life. That had been the case here, moreover, since the analysis of the hard disk yielded numerous work documents (“LGV photos” file, “warehouse photos” ... .\n",
      "The term “fun”, moreover, does not clearly convey that the file in question is necessarily private. The term can denote exchanges between colleagues at work or work documents kept as “bloopers” by the employee. The employer also rightly pointed out that the user’s charter provided that “private information [had to] be clearly identified as such (“private” option in the Outlook criteria)” and that the same was true of the media receiving that information (“private” folder). The lower court was therefore correct in considering that the file had not been identified as personal.\n",
      "The same applies to the files containing the impugned certificates registered under the names “Fred [P.]”, “SOCRIF” and “Catherine”.”.  The Court of Appeal also held that the applicant’s dismissal from the service had not been disproportionate. It observed that both the SNCF’s Code of Professional Conduct and the internal rules provided that staff were required to use the computers provided to them for exclusively professional ends, with the occasional private use being merely tolerated. It found that the applicant had committed a “massive breach of those rules, going as far as using his work tools to produce a forged document”. In the court’s view, those acts had been particularly serious because, as an official responsible for general surveillance, he would have been expected to be of exemplary conduct..  The applicant appealed on points of law. He submitted, in particular, that there had been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention. The Social Division of the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal in a judgment of 4 July 2012. It held as follows:\n",
      "“ ... whilst files created by an employee with the assistance of the computer facilities supplied to him by his employer for work purposes are presumed to be professional in nature, meaning that the employer is entitled to open them in the employee’s absence, unless they are identified as personal, the description given to the hard disk itself cannot confer privacy on all the data contained in it. The Court of Appeal, which found that labelling the hard disk in the employee’s computer “D:/ personal data” could not enable him to use it for purely private purposes and prohibit access by the employer, drew the legitimate conclusion that the files in question, which had not been identified as “private” according to the recommendations of the IT charter, could be lawfully opened by the employer.\n",
      "The Court of Appeal, which found that the employee had stored 1,562 pornographic files representing a volume of 787 megabytes over a period of four years, and that he had also used his work computer to produce forged certificates, rightly held that such misuse of his office equipment in breach of the rules in force at the SNCF amounted to a breach of his contractual obligations. ...”.\n",

The court noted that, in contrast to section 6 of the Companies Act 1993 which required the creditors of a company to prove that a member of the company had abused the corporate form (see paragraph 34 below), the FOCA had introduced a “non-rebuttable” presumption that the members of a struck-off company were deemed to have undertaken joint and several liability for any outstanding debts of the company. In accordance with the Constitutional Court’s ruling, they could be exonerated from their personal liability only if they demonstrated that they were “passive members” of the company (see paragraphs 46 and 51 below). Lastly, the court took note of the fact that the applicant had indeed made a winding-up petition on behalf of L.E., but it considered this irrelevant because L.E. had at the time failed to make the required advance payment and the petition had therefore been rejected (see paragraphs 15 and 18 above)..  On 5 May 2006 the applicant lodged two constitutional complaints. In one of them, he complained that the decisions rendered in the strike-off proceedings against L.E. had been served on that company alone and not on him personally. In the other one, he complained about the outcome of the enforcement proceedings against him..  On 31 January 2007 the Constitutional Court rejected the applicant’s complaint regarding the strike-off proceedings. The decision was served on the applicant on 5 February 2007. It found that the applicant lacked legal interest in challenging those proceedings, since L.E. had already been struck off from the court register. Consequently, even a positive outcome of the constitutional complaint could not improve the applicant’s position..  On 9 July 2007 the Constitutional Court also rejected the complaint regarding the enforcement proceedings as manifestly ill-founded. It held that the lower courts had correctly applied the Constitutional Court’s criteria for differentiating between active and passive members to the applicant’s individual situation..  In 2010 the judgment of 22 November 2000 was enforced in part by direct deduction from the applicant’s salary. On 23 September 2011 the applicant reached an out-of-court settlement with the creditor and paid the agreed amount. The enforcement proceedings against the applicant were terminated on 28 September 2011. In total, the applicant paid EUR 32,795 to the Slovenian Railways. It is not clear how much other members of L.E. have paid to the Slovenian Railways in this connection.\n",

      "The case concerned the publication of a newspaper article on the website of The New York Times. In the article the applicant had been mentioned by name and, based on reports by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (hereinafter “the FBI”) and European law-enforcement agencies, the applicant’s alleged ties to Russian organised crime had been publicised. The applicant’s attempt to obtain an injunction order before the domestic courts had been unsuccessful.. The applicant was born in 1947 and lives in Düsseldorf. He is an internationally active entrepreneur in the media sector and chief executive officer of the media company Innova Film GmbH.. He also holds the position of Vice-President of the World Jewish Congress and President of the Jewish Confederation of Ukraine. In 2010 the former mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, publicly honoured the applicant for his efforts to improve American‑Russian relations.. On 12 June 2001, the daily newspaper The New York Times published an article about an investigation into corruption against R.L. A slightly changed version was also published on the newspaper’s website. The online version, which was the subject of the domestic proceedings (see paragraphs 12-20 below), reads, in so far as relevant, as follows (emphasis added and names abbreviated by the Court):\n",
      "“[L] Media Company Faces a Federal Inquiry\n",
      "By [R. B.]\n",
      "Published: June 12 2001\n",
      "WASHINGTON, June 10— A company owned by [R.L.], the cosmetics heir and former New York City mayoral candidate, is under investigation by federal prosecutors over allegations that it paid at least $1 million in bribes to Ukrainian officials for a valuable television license, according to lawyers and Justice Department documents.\n",
      "The United States attorney in Manhattan, [M.W.], has empaneled a grand jury and issued subpoenas, and prosecutors are studying some 6,000 pages of documents from Central European Media enterprise, which [R.L.] founded in 1991 as part of a plan to build a media empire in Europe. It now owns television stations in several Central and Eastern European countries.\n",
      "In a Federal District Court filing in New York last year, [M.W.] sought the corporate documents, saying that they were needed for a criminal investigation into whether [R.L.]´s Central European Media had ‘made corrupt and unlawful payments to Ukrainian officials’ in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the federal law that prohibits American companies from paying bribes abroad. [R.L.] and the company did not challenge the request and turned over the documents, a lawyer said.\n",
      "The payments being examined took place in 1996 after Ukraine´s licencing body granted a potentially lucrative licence to [R.L.]´s company despite the fact that the Ukraine Parliament had imposed a ban on new licences.\n",
      "...\n",
      "In Ukraine, Central European Media controls the most popular station through its majority-owned subsidiary Studio 1 + 1.\n",
      "Prosecutors are studying two transactions related to Central European Media’s Ukraine investment, according to documents and persons close to the investigation. In one, prosecutors are trying to determine if L’s company paid $1.2 million to two Lebanese businessmen living in Ukraine, who then distributed it to some members of Ukraine’s television licensing board.\n",
      "... [R.L.]’s bid to gain the television license in Ukraine began in 1995. That year, he met in New York with [O.V.], a top adviser to Ukraine President [L.K.], to discuss business opportunities.\n",
      "The initial meetings between [R.L.] and his representatives and [O.V.] were not promising. ...\n",
      "[O.V.] suggested that [R.L.] team up with a new Ukrainian television broadcasting company, Studio 1 + 1, in Kiev, and he did. The principal owners were [V.R.] and Boris Fuchsmann, well known around Kiev for their influence and wealth. Less well known were their ties to Russian organized crime, according to reports by the F.B.I. and European law enforcement agencies.\n",
      "[V.R.], who no longer has an interest in 1 + 1, has denied any links to Russian organized crime. Mr. Fuchsmann did not respond to e-mail inquiries seeking comment on the licensing deal and the F.B.I.’s claim of his ties to organized crime, although an assistant confirmed that he had received the inquiries.\n",
      "A 1994 F.B.I. report on Russian organized crime in the United States described Mr. Fuchsmann as a gold smuggler and embezzler, whose company in Germany was part of an international organized crime network. He is barred from entering the United States.\n",
      "...\n",
      "Besides Mr. Fuchsmann and [V.R.], there were other, silent owners of Studio 1 + 1. In one internal fax, in April 1996, [J] described the Studio 1 + 1 shareholders as ‘‘extremely powerful’ people whom, she added, ‘I will not mention on this fax.’\n",
      "Central European Media now owns 60 percent of Studio 1 + 1, and Mr. Fuchsmann owns at least 30 percent, according to public statements.\n",
      "At the time it went into business with Mr. Fuchsmann and [V.R.], Central European Media did not conduct investigations into their backgrounds, according to a report by [R.L.]’s New York law firm, [D.&P.].\n",
      "In their 20-page report, which the prosecutors now have, the firm’s lawyers said that [R.L.] had been justified in dealing with Mr. Fuchsmann and [V.R.] because they had been highly recommended by [O.V.], whom the lawyers described as ‘an ardent supporter of free-market business’.\n",
      "The lawyers also concluded that Central European Media had not engaged in any illegal or improper activities. They said they could not rule out the possibility that Studio 1 + 1 had made improper payments, though they did not believe it had.\n",
      "The Ukraine’s television licensing board issued a broadcast license to Studio 1 + 1 not only in spite of Parliament’s moratorium, but with only four of the board’s eight members present; the law required at least six members for a vote.\n",
      "A few days after the license was issued, Central European Media transferred $1.4 million to International Teleservices of Belize, according to a C.M.E. Wire Transfer Request. That is the second transaction being looked at by prosecutors.\n",
      "The Belize company was indirectly owned by ‘many high Ukrainian officials,’ according to a second C.M.E. document, which did not name them.\n",
      "A third document shows that International Teleservices had paid this amount to a company in Germany owned by Mr. Fuchsmann, Innova, and that Innova had paid the license fees on behalf of Studio 1 + 1. Innova is part of a Russian organized crime network, according to U.S. and German law enforcement reports.\n",
      "It is not clear why such a circuitous route was used, and a person involved in the transaction, with inside knowledge of the owners of International Teleservices, said the $1.4 million payment was not for a license fee. He would not say what it was for.\n",
      "Central European Media officials were nervous about the license they won, and sought the opinion of two law firms in Kiev. Both acknowledged ‘the potential weaknesses’ of the broadcasting license, according to a C.M.E. document. One week later, O.V. had secured a letter from the Ukrainian justice ministry stating that the license was valid.\n",
      "Federal prosecutors, who opened their case in the wake of a number of private lawsuits challenging the legitimacy of the license award, have been examining documents for nearly a year, and the exact status of the investigation is not clear.”.  On 28 May 2001, before publication of the article, the journalist had notified the applicant, via an email to one of his employees, of the planned publication and had asked several questions. On 30 May 2001 the journalist had made a follow-up telephone call to the employee, who confirmed that the applicant had received the questions. However, the applicant refrained from answering the questions or commenting on the planned publication..  Since 12 June 2001 the article, showing the date of first publication, is retrievable from the website of The New York Times. It can also be found through online search engines such as “Google” or “Bing”..  On 31 July 2002 the applicant sought injunctions against certain parts of the article (highlighted in the article, see paragraph 9 above), published in the print and online versions..  On 9 January 2008 the Düsseldorf Regional Court declared the applicant’s action inadmissible due to lack of international jurisdiction on the part of the German courts. It found that, at the material time, the print version of The New York Times was not distributed in Germany and that the Internet version of the newspaper was not directed at a readership in Germany. The Düsseldorf Court of Appeal confirmed that decision by its judgment dated 30 December 2008. On 2 March 2010 the Federal Court of Justice quashed the part of the decision regarding the applicant’s claim for an injunction against the challenged statements in the online version of the article and referred that part of the action back to the Court of Appeal. The court held that the online version of the newspaper was accessible from Germany, and because it mentioned a German businessman in the article, the publication had a direct connection with Germany and German jurisdiction. It therefore affirmed the international jurisdiction of the German courts in that respect..  On 22 June 2011 the Court of Appeal decided on the part of the dispute which had been referred back to it by the Federal Court of Justice. It granted the injunction in so far as the article stated that the applicant had been banned from entering the United States, and dismissed the remainder of the applicant’s action for lack of merit. The Court of Appeal held that German law was applicable with regard to the online publication, as the article was accessible in Germany via the Internet and therefore the alleged violation of the applicant’s reputation had at least occurred in Germany..  The court accepted that the statements interfered with the applicant’s reputation and personality right (allgemeines Persönlichkeitsrecht) as protected by Article 2 § 1 and Article 1 § 1 of the Basic Law (Grundgesetz). However, as the statements had been made in the press, which was constitutionally protected pursuant to Article 5 § 1 of the Basic Law, it was necessary to balance both interests. Moreover, as the statements concerned a suspicion against the applicant, the presumption of innocence arising from Article 6 § 2 of the Convention and from German law also had to be taken into account. The court held that there was in principle a public interest in reporting on criminal offences, including the suspicion of their commission. On the other hand, continued the court, the interference with the rights of personality associated with such reporting required higher standards of care for newspaper reporting, because even if the investigation was later discontinued, “something of the accusation might stick to the person affected”. Therefore, concrete, provable connecting facts which go beyond a vague, intangible suspicion were required, the reporting must concern an incident of great weight and the suspicion must be identified as such. In addition, the reporting must be balanced, the journalist must not fail to report on exculpatory circumstances and the person concerned must, as a rule, be invited to make his own comments before publication..  As regards the statements at issue, the Court of Appeal held that there was a great informational interest on the part of the public in the reporting that the applicant, as a German businessman internationally active in the media sector, was suspected by the secret service of being involved in gold smuggling, embezzlement and organised crime. This assessment was not changed by the fact that the applicant had been mentioned by name in the article, or by the fact that when the article was published in 2001, the criminal offences mentioned therein had occurred more than sixteen years previously. Regarding the latter the court pointed out that the criminal offences had become relevant again, due to new suspicions regarding the involvement of a former mayoral candidate. For the understanding of these suspicions it had been necessary to elaborate on the companies and individuals, including the applicant, involved in the alleged corruption. Similarly, describing the suspected criminal backgrounds of some of the persons involved had been necessary for the readers’ comprehension of the allegation. The court also took into account that the article remained accessible in an online archive of the daily newspaper. It held that there was a recognised public interest not only in information on current events but also in being able to research events from recent history..  The court further considered that the reporting was free from polemic statements and insinuations, and made it sufficiently clear that only insights from FBI reports and the law-enforcement authorities were being reported. This was expressly pointed out in the challenged article with the words, \"according to reports by the F.B.I. and European law enforcement agencies\". The internal FBI report was confirmed by reports of several other law-enforcement agencies, and the applicant himself, while denying any criminal activities, confirmed certain facts mentioned in those reports during the proceedings. Furthermore, the author of the article had notified the applicant via email that the article would be published. In that context the court also considered that although the applicant had been aware of the defendant’s reporting even before the article had been published, he had waited for more than one year before applying for an injunction against the defendant. Therefore, the applicant had not perceived the interference with his personality right as intolerable..  In sum, the court concluded that the defendant had complied with the required journalistic duty of care and that the reporting had relied on sources and background information, which the journalist could reasonably consider reliable. Therefore, the informational interest of the public outweighed the concerns of protecting the applicant’s personality right, even taking into account that such reporting might seriously damage his private and professional reputation. Regarding the alleged entry ban, the court concluded that there had been no reliable sources and that the applicant had shown that he had recently travelled to the United States..  On 2 October 2012, the Federal Court of Justice rejected a complaint lodged by the applicant against the Court of Appeal’s refusal to grant leave to appeal on points of law..  On 26 April 2013 the Federal Constitutional Court declined to consider a constitutional complaint (no. 1 BvR 2387/12) lodged by the applicant, without providing reasons.\n",

      "The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Chişinău.. The applicant had a dispute with H. over ownership of a house. He brought a claim against H. seeking acknowledgement of his property rights, as his father’s heir, and H.’s eviction from the house. H. lodged a counterclaim, seeking acknowledgement of her property rights to the house as she had built it.. On 20 December 2007 the Buiucani District Court dismissed H.’s counterclaim and allowed the applicant’s claim in full. H. lodged an appeal. On 20 May 2008 the Chișinău Court of Appeal upheld the earlier judgment and dismissed H.’s appeal. H. did not attend the appellate hearing, even though the summons had been repeatedly sent to the address she had provided in her appeal. A registered letter was returned with a note stating that H. did not live at the address indicated by her. The judgment became final after the expiry of the two-month time-limit for lodging an appeal on points of law.. On 11 May 2009 H. lodged an appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court of Justice, stating that she had only learned of the judgment of 20 May 2008 on 23 April 2009. In her application, she indicated the same address as in the proceedings before the Court of Appeal. The applicant asked the Supreme Court of Justice to dismiss the appeal as being lodged outside the legal time-limit. He submitted that since it had been H. who had lodged the appeal with the Chişinău Court of Appeal, it had been her duty to enquire about the progress of the proceedings and not to wait for a year before doing so.. On 16 October 2009 the Supreme Court of Justice allowed H.’s appeal on points of law, quashed the previous judgments and delivered a new judgment on the merits of the case dividing the disputed house into equal shares between the applicant and H. The court argued that the appeal had not been lodged outside the time-limit because H. had not attended the hearing before the Court of Appeal and there was nothing in the file to suggest that that court had informed her of the availability of the full judgment. The court concluded that without any evidence of the date when H. had learned of the judgment, her appeal was considered to have been submitted on time. The judgment was final.\n",

      "The applicant was born in 1939 and lives in Sofia.. The applicant owns one half of a plot of land in the village of Golyamo Buchino, close to the city of Pernik. He also owned one half of a house standing on the plot, in which he lived until 1997, and one half of two smaller buildings, a barn and a pen. Those buildings no longer exist.. On an unspecified date towards the end of the 1980s or the beginning of the 1990s the State took a decision to create an opencast coalmine near the village. In a decision of 8 May 1990 the local mayor expropriated about ninety properties in the area for that purpose, including the applicant’s land and buildings.. The expropriation decision stated that the applicant should receive in compensation another plot of land in the village. The applicant received additionally a sum of money (the parties have not presented the decision of the mayor on the additional compensation). The majority of the remaining owners received either monetary compensation or flats in the city of Pernik. As another plot was not provided to the applicant within the statutory time‑limit of one year, on 21 August 1992 he requested that the expropriation be cancelled, as he was entitled to under section 102 of the Property Act (see paragraph 24 below). Another person who was due a plot of land in compensation also applied to have the expropriation of her property cancelled. In a decision of 2 October 1992 the Pernik regional governor cancelled the two expropriations, noting that the plots of land due in compensation had not been provided “owing to the impossibility for the municipality to ensure such plots”. The decision stated furthermore that the owners had to pay back the monetary compensation they had additionally received. On 22 December 1993 the applicant paid back that compensation.. The applicant remained in his house. In the years which followed the mine approached the house, due to its gradual enlargement. Coal was extracted from it by means of detonations, which, according to the applicant, shook the house on a daily basis. On unspecified dates cracks appeared on the walls of the house, and the barn and the pen collapsed. Towards the beginning of 1997 the applicant’s family moved out of the house, judging it too dangerous to stay..  Subsequently, the applicant contacted the mine, seeking to obtain compensation, but the negotiations failed. At the time, the mine was managed by a company which was wholly State-owned. In 2005 it was privatised..  In 2001 the applicant brought a tort action against the company operating the mine, seeking compensation for the damage caused to his property..  The Pernik Regional Court (“the Regional Court”), which examined the case at first instance, heard a witness, a neighbour of the applicant, who stated during a court hearing of 13 December 2001 that the walls of the applicant’s house were cracked, that its state continued to deteriorate, and that the barn had collapsed three or four years earlier. He thought that the house had been well constructed, and explained that after the initial damage the applicant had attempted to repair it. On 7 March 2002 the Regional Court heard another witness, who stated that most of the damage to the applicant’s house had been caused three or four years earlier..  The Regional Court appointed an expert, who established that the house had been constructed between 1948 and 1950, when there had been no requirements as to seismic resistance. At the time of drawing up the expert report the house was uninhabitable, as its walls were bent and cracked, with the cracks sometimes reaching 20-35 cm in width. The distance between the house and the mine’s periphery was about 160‑180 metres. This meant that the house was situated well inside the so‑called “sanitation zone” consisting of land within 500 metres of the mine’s edge, inside which the law prohibited any dwellings. The “security zone” for the mine, within which no unauthorised person was to be present during detonation works, had a radius of 600 metres. The expert confirmed his conclusions at a court meeting on 24 January 2002..  In a judgment of 27 June 2003 the Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s action. It considered it established that the applicant’s property had been seriously damaged and that the damage had coincided in time with the beginning of detonation works in the mine. Still, it concluded that the applicant had not proven that a causal link existed between the damage and the detonations. He had relied in that regard on the witness testimony provided by two neighbours, but according to the Regional Court it was impossible to establish what had caused the damage to the property by way of witness testimony. The burden of proof to establish such a circumstance lay on the applicant and the other party had argued that the damage had been due to the manner of construction of his house..  The applicant lodged an appeal. Before the Sofia Court of Appeal (“the Court of Appeal”) he called an additional witness, who stated during a hearing on 2 February 2004 that many houses in the area had already collapsed, and that all the other houses in the applicant’s neighbourhood had cracks..  On 25 June 2004 the Court of Appeal upheld the Regional Court’s judgment, confirming its reasoning. It held that while witness testimony could establish the extent and the timing of the damage to the applicant’s property, it could not prove the causal link between that damage and the detonation works at the mine..  The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. In a judgment of 5 April 2006 the Supreme Court of Cassation quashed the Court of Appeal’s judgment and remitted the case for fresh examination. It was of the view that the lower courts had not duly accounted for the fact that the mine operated in a prohibited area close to the applicant’s house, the house being situated within both the “sanitation zone” and the “security zone” around the mine. The lower courts had had to examine this fact in light of the statements of the witnesses, which had “established the circumstance” that the damage to the applicant’s property had been the result of the detonation works. It was also necessary to assess compliance by the company operating the mine with other statutory requirements, such as those concerning environmental protection..  After the case was remitted, the Court of Appeal commissioned a new expert report. The expert noted that, owing to the passage of time and the destruction of some documents, it was impossible to determine the exact distance between the applicant’s house and the area where the detonations had been carried out in 1997. Nevertheless, it was clear that the house had been well inside the “sanitation zone” around the mine. The expert additionally noted that the detonations had been carried out by qualified workers, in accordance with the mine’s internal rules..  The Court of Appeal heard an additional witness for the applicant, who stated during a court hearing of 23 November 2006 that many houses in the village had collapsed, and that he thought that this was due to the detonations at the mine. He added that the detonations took place on a daily basis, that they caused “earthquakes”, and that the houses shattered as a result. The first cracks on the applicant’s house had appeared even before the time when the mine had operated closest to it. The witness was not aware of any landslides in the area..  In a judgment of 2 April 2007 the Court of Appeal once again upheld the Regional Court’s judgment of 27 June 2003, dismissing the applicant’s claim. It found it “indisputable” that employees of the mine had acted in breach of law, by carrying out detonations in a prohibited area close to residential buildings, including at the time when, according to the applicant, the damage to his property had started. Nevertheless, on the basis of the material submitted, the applicant had not proved the causal link between the mine’s work and the damage to his property. The Court of Appeal reasoned in that regard:\n",
      "“The causal link ... cannot be assumed – it is to be fully proven by the claimant. It has not been shown in the case that the claimant’s building, constructed in the 1950s, has been damaged precisely because of the detonation works at the mine. The claimant has not shown that the residential building and the auxiliary buildings, given [their] manner of construction, the materials [used] and the time of [their] construction, would not have been damaged, or would not have been damaged to such an extent, had it not been for the detonation works at the mine. It has not been shown whether and to what degree the buildings’ state described by the expert [heard by the Regional Court] was due to normal wear and tear, taking into account the year [they were built] and the manner of [their] construction, and any lack of maintenance by the owner after the 1990 expropriation.”.  Upon a further appeal by the applicant, in a final judgment of 3 July 2008 the Supreme Court of Cassation upheld the Court of Appeal’s judgment, affirming its conclusions. It pointed out in particular that the expert report presented to the Court of Appeal (see paragraph 18 above) had only established that the applicant’s property had been situated within the “sanitation zone” around the mine, but “was insufficient to prove the existence of a causal link between the damage ... and the unlawful behaviour of employees of the respondent company”..  In the meantime, the applicant’s house has collapsed and no longer exists. The property has been abandoned.\n",

[[On]] [[25]] [[March]] [[1998]] the [[local]] authority entered into [[possession]] [[of]] [[the]] [[requisitioned]] [[plots]] [[of]] land and [[paid]] [[the]] [[compensation]] [[to]] the [[applicants]], [[who]] only provisionally [[accepted]] [[the]] sum, while reserving their [[right]] to bring [[court]] proceedings [[against]] the [[requisition]] orders..  [[On]] [[13]] April 1998 [[some]] [[of]] [[the]] above-mentioned [[owners]] challenged [[the]] [[administrative]] decisions [[in]] [[court]]. [[The]] legal predecessor [[of]] [[the]] [[first]] applicant [[and]] [[the]] [[second]] [[applicant]] [[himself]] were [[parties]] to [[the]] proceedings, [[but]] not [[the]] [[third]] [[applicant]] [[or]] [[his]] [[legal]] [[predecessor]]..  [[On]] 16 [[March]] 2005, following two [[remittals]] [[ordered]] [[by]] [[the]] Budapest Court [[of]] [[Appeal]], the Budapest [[High]] [[Court]] [[delivered]] [[a]] [[first-instance]] [[judgment]] [[and]] [[dismissed]] [[the]] claim..  [[On]] [[30]] November 2005 the Budapest [[Court]] [[of]] Appeal [[overturned]] [[the]] [[first-instance]] [[judgment]] [[and]] ordered [[new]] administrative [[proceedings]]. [[It]] [[held]] [[that]] [[the]] local [[authority]]’[[s]] [[decision]] had been [[tainted]] [[by]] a [[procedural]] irregularity, [[in]] [[that]] [[the]] local [[authority]]’s notary (who had [[adopted]] the decision of [[19]] [[January]] 1998) should have [[abstained]] from [[taking]] [[a]] [[decision]] in [[a]] [[case]] [[in]] [[which]] the [[local]] [[authority]] [[employing]] him [[had]] been [[one]] [[of]] the [[interested]] parties..  [[Accordingly]], [[the]] [[Budapest]] [[District]] XI [[Mayor]]’s [[Office]] [[was]] [[appointed]] [[to]] conduct [[new]] [[first-instance]] [[administrative]] proceedings. On 7 [[February]] [[2008]] it [[adopted]] a decision [[identical]] to [[that]] [[of]] [[19]] [[January]] [[1998]] (see paragraph [[7]] above)..  [[On]] [[2]] [[July]] [[2008]] [[the]] decision [[was]] [[upheld]] [[on]] [[appeal]] [[by]] [[the]] [[Public]] [[Administration]] [[Office]] of Budapest, [[with]] [[an]] amendment that [[the]] [[compensation]] figures [[should]] [[be]] increased by [[accrued]] interest..  On [[27]] [[August]] 2008 [[the]] [[first]] [[applicant]] challenged the [[new]] [[administrative]] [[decision]] in [[court]]. [[The]] second [[and]] third applicants [[intervened]] ([[beavatkozó]]) [[in]] the [[proceedings]] [[in]] [[support]] of [[the]] [[first]] [[applicant]]..  On 11 March [[2010]] [[the]] Budapest [[High]] [[Court]] [[found]] [[for]] [[the]] applicants, [[quashed]] the administrative [[decision]] [[because]] [[it]] had [[been]] adopted [[on]] the [[basis]] of [[a]] [[legal]] [[provision]] previously [[annulled]] by [[the]] [[Constitutional]] [[Court]], and [[ordered]] [[new]] proceedings..  [[On]] [[10]] January [[2015]] [[the]] [[Budapest]] [[Government]] [[Office]] (Budapest [[Főváros]] [[Kormányhivatala]]) adopted a [[new]] [[administrative]] [[decision]], [[with]] [[the]] [[same]] [[content]] as [[before]], but [[on]] [[different]] [[legal]] [[grounds]]..  [[On]] 9 [[February]] [[2015]] [[the]] [[applicants]] brought court [[proceedings]] [[against]] [[that]] decision..  On 19 [[April]] 2016 [[the]] [[Budapest]] [[Administrative]] and [[Labour]] [[Court]] [[delivered]] its [[judgment]]. It dismissed the [[applicants]]’ [[action]] [[as]] far [[as]] [[the]] [[requisition]]’[[s]] [[lawfulness]] was concerned [[but]] [[quashed]] the [[administrative]] [[decision]] as [[regards]] the compensation amount. [[It]] held [[that]] the compensation [[amount]] should be set at [[such]] [[sum]] [[as]] reflected by [[an]] [[assessment]] [[of]] the [[value]] [[of]] [[the]] [[properties]] [[as]] at 2015 [[and]] that [[the]] [[assessment]] [[should]] [[be]] carried [[out]] in accordance [[with]] [[the]] provisions of Government [[Decree]] [[no]]. [[58]]/[[2015]] (III.[[24]]). The government decree in [[question]] [[contained]] a table [[for]] [[the]] purposes of [[calculating]] [[social]] security [[pensions]]. [[In]] [[that]] [[table]], [[different]] [[multiplication]] factors [[were]] [[associated]] [[with]] [[different]] [[years]] (from 1950 onwards), [[making]] it [[thus]] possible to calculate [[the]] [[current]] value of [[salaries]] [[and]] [[incomes]] [[received]] [[during]] [[previous]] employment..  On 14 June 2017 [[the]] Kúria [[quashed]] the [[final]] [[judgment]] [[and]] [[remitted]] [[the]] [[case]] to the [[Budapest]] Administrative [[and]] [[Labour]] [[Court]] for [[the]] [[recalculation]] of [[the]] [[compensation]] [[amount]]. [[It]] [[held]] that the [[method]] of assessing [[the]] [[valuations]] applied [[in]] [[the]] first-instance judgment [[could]] [[not]] be used [[in]] [[the]] [[context]] [[of]] the case; [[instead]], [[the]] [[amount]] to [[be]] [[paid]] [[should]] [[be]] [[calculated]] [[by]] an expert on the [[basis]] of [[the]] [[properties]]’ [[market]] [[values]] [[on]] 10 [[January]] [[2015]], [[from]] [[which]] [[the]] compensation [[already]] [[received]] in 1998 ([[see]] paragraph 10 [[above]]) should [[be]] deducted..  [[Throughout]] [[the]] [[court]] proceedings, [[the]] Land [[Registry]] has retained [[a]] [[record]] [[of]] [[the]] [[dispute]] ([[perfeljegyzés]])..  The [[public]] [[road]] [[contemplated]] [[by]] the local [[authority]]’[[s]] [[requisition]] order [[of]] 1998 (see paragraph [[7]] [[above]]) [[has]] [[yet]] to be [[constructed]]. [[At]] the date of [[the]] [[latest]] information [[available]] to [[the]] Court (2 October 2018), [[the]] [[proceedings]] concerning [[the]] [[amount]] of compensation due to the [[applicants]] [[were]] still [[pending]] before [[the]] [[domestic]] [[courts]].\n",
